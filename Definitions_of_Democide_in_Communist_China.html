Those targeted during the campaign in were thereafter labeled as &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot;, and were publicly denounced in mass trials. Significant numbers of &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot; were arrested and executed and even more sentenced to &quot;labor reform&quot;. . . The suppression of counterrevolutionaries targeted mainly former Kuomintang officials and intellectuals suspected of disloyalty. At least 712,000 people were executed, 1,290,000 were imprisoned in labor camps and 1,200,000 were &quot;subject to control at various times.&quot; (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Chinese Civil War (1927-1949/1950) was a civil war fought between the Kuomintang (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party), the governing party of the Republic of China, and the Communist Party of China (CPC), for the control of China which eventually led to China's division into two Chinas, Republic of China (now commonly known as Taiwan) and People's Republic of China (Mainland China). The war began in April 1927, amidst the Northern Expedition. The war represented an ideological split between the Nationalist KMT, and the Communist CPC. In mainland China today, the last three years of the war (1947–1949) are more commonly known as the War of Liberation. The civil war continued intermittently until the Second Sino-Japanese War interrupted it, resulting in the two parties forming a Second United Front. Japan's campaign was defeated in 1945, marking the end of World War II, and China's full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. After a further four years, 1950 saw a cessation of major military hostilities—with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling mainland China (including Hainan Island), and the Republic of China's jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and several outlying islands. To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended. Today, the entities on the two sides of the Taiwan strait have close economic ties. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, leading ideologists of communism, wrote &quot;The [written] history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle&quot;. Marx's notion of class has nothing to do with social class in the sociological sense of upper, middle and lower classes (which are often defined in terms of quantitative income or wealth). Instead, in an age of capitalism, Marx describes an economic class. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Although nominally it exists alongside the United Front, in practice, the CPC is the only party of the PRC, maintaining a unitary government centralizing the state, military, and media. The legal power of the Communist Party is guaranteed by the PRC constitution. The party was founded in July, 1921 in Shanghai. After a lengthy civil war, the party defeated its primary rival, the Kuomintang (KMT), and expanded into all of mainland China by 1949. The Kuomintang retreated to the island of Taiwan, which it still retains to this day. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

The sociologist Max Weber developed a tripartite classification of authority; the cult of personality holds parallels with what Weber defined as 'charismatic authority'. A cult of personality is similar to hero worship, except that it is established by mass media and propaganda. However, the term may be applied by analogy to refer to adulation of religious or non-political leaders. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, it was designed to further advance socialism in the country by removing capitalist elements from Chinese society, and impose Maoist orthodoxy within the Party. The movement brought chaos, as social norms largely evaporated and the previously established political institutions disintegrated at all levels of government. The Revolution was launched in May 1966. Mao alleged that bourgeois elements were entering the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. He insisted that these &quot;revisionists&quot; be removed through violent class struggle. China's youth then responded to Mao's appeal by forming Red Guard groups around the country. The movement then spread into the military, urban workers, and the Communist Party leadership itself. It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life. In the top leadership, it led to a mass purge of senior officials who were accused of deviating from the socialist path, most notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. During the same period Mao's personality cult grew to immense proportions. The Cultural Revolution damaged the country on a great scale economically and socially. Millions of people were persecuted in the violent factional struggles that ensued across the country, and suffered a wide range of abuses including torture, rape, imprisonment, sustained harassment, and seizure of property. A large segment of the population was forcibly displaced, most notably the transfer of urban youth to rural regions during the Down to the Countryside Movement. Historical relics and artifacts were destroyed. Cultural and religious sites were ransacked. Mao officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, but its active phase lasted until the death of Lin Biao in 1971. The political instability between 1971 and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution. After Mao's death in 1976, forces within the Party that opposed the Cultural Revolution, led by Deng Xiaoping, gained prominence. Most of the Maoist reforms associated with the Cultural Revolution were abandoned by 1978. The Cultural Revolution has been treated officially as a negative phenomenon ever since; in 1981, the Party assigned chief responsibility to Mao, but also laid significant blame on Lin Biao and the Gang of Four for causing its worst excesses. . . Sinologists Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals estimate that between 750,000 and 1.5 million people were killed in the violence of the Cultural Revolution, in rural China alone. Mao's Red Guards were given carte blanche to abuse and kill the revolution's enemies. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

As a result of the anti-bourgeois thinking prevalent during the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong declared certain privileged urban youth would be sent to mountainous areas or farming villages, in order that they could learn from the workers and farmers there. Mao's policy differed from Liu Shaoqi's early 1960s sending-down policy, for its political context. Liu Shaoqi instituted the first sending-down policy to redistribute excess urban population following the Great Chinese Famine and the Great Leap Forward. Mao's use of the policy sent-down the Red Guards who had risen up at his beck and call, sending China into chaos. Essentially, Mao used the &quot;up to the mountains and down to the villages&quot; to quell unrest and remove the embarrassment of the early Cultural Revolution from sight. As a result, many fresh high school graduates, who became known as the Rusticated Youth of China, were forced out of the cities and effectively exiled to remote areas of China. Some commentators consider these people, many of whom lost the opportunity to attend university, China's &quot;lost generation.&quot; Famous authors who have written about their experiences during the movement include Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, Jiang Rong, and Zhang Chengzhi, both of whom went to Inner Mongolia. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

They came to prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) and were subsequently charged with a series of treasonous crimes. The members consisted of Jiang Qing, Mao Zedong's last wife as the leading figure of the group, and her close associates Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen. The Gang of Four effectively controlled the power organs of the Communist Party of China through the latter stages of the Cultural Revolution, although it remains unclear which major decisions were made through Mao Zedong and carried out by the Gang, and which were the result of the Gang of Four's own planning. The Gang of Four, together with disgraced Communist general Lin Biao, were labeled the two major &quot;counter-revolutionary forces&quot; of the Cultural Revolution and officially blamed by the Chinese government for the worst excesses of the societal chaos that ensued during the ten years of turmoil. Their downfall in a coup d'état on October 6, 1976, a mere month after Mao's death, brought about major celebrations on the streets of Beijing and marked the end of a turbulent political era in China. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Both drought/poor weather conditions and the policies of the Communist Party of China have contributed to the famine, although the relative weights of the contributions are disputed. According to government statistics, there were 15 million excess deaths in this period. Unofficial estimates vary, but scholars have estimated the number of famine victims to be between 20 and 43 million. Yang Jisheng, a former Xinhua News Agency reporter who spent over ten years gathering information available to no other scholars, estimates excess deaths of 36 million. Historian Frank Dikötter, having been granted special access to Chinese archival materials, estimates that there were at least 45 million premature deaths from 1958 to 1962. The phrases &quot;Three Years of Economic Difficulty&quot; and &quot;Three Bitter Years&quot; are also used by Chinese officials to describe this period. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

He said: “When there is not enough to eat people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.” Dikötter estimates that at least 2.5 million people were summarily killed or tortured to death during this period. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

It is a part of a wider modernization process, where social change and economic development are closely related with technological innovation, particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature, and a sociological process of ubiquitous rationalization. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Its guiding ideology is the Three Principles of the People, espoused by Sun Yat-sen. It is the founding and the oldest political party in the Republic of China and its party headquarters are located in Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. It is currently (as of 2011) the ruling political party of the ROC, and is the majority party in terms of seats in the Legislative Yuan, The KMT is a member of the International Democrat Union. Current president Ma Ying-jeou, elected in 2008, is the seventh KMT member to hold the office of the presidency. Together with the People First Party and Chinese New Party, the KMT forms what is known as the Taiwanese Pan-Blue coalition, which supports eventual unification with the mainland. However, the KMT has been forced to moderate their stance by advocating political and legal status quo of modern Taiwan. The KMT accepts a &quot;One China Principle&quot; - it officially considers that there is only one China and that the Republic of China (not the People's Republic of China) is its legitimate government. However, since 2008, in order to ease tensions with the People's Republic of China, the KMT endorses the &quot;three nos&quot; policy as defined by Ma Ying-jeou - no unification, no independence and no use of force. The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution. Later led by Chiang Kai-shek, it ruled much of China from 1928 until its retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after being defeated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) during the Chinese Civil War. There, the KMT controlled the government under a single party state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s loosened its grip on power.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

It is estimated that in the last fifty years more than 50 million people have been sent to laogai camps. Laogai is distinguished from laojiao, or re-education through labor, which is an administrative detention for a person who is not a criminal but has committed minor offenses, and is intended to reform offenders into law-abiding citizens. Persons detained under laojiao are detained in facilities which are separate from the general prison system of laogai. Both systems, however, involve penal labor. In 1990 China abandoned the term laogai and started labeling the facilities as &quot;prisons&quot; instead. China's 1997 revised Criminal Procedure Law brought an end to official laogai policy, but some prisons in the Tibet Autonomous Region and in Qinghai still practice forced labor and amount to a continuation of laogai. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

There was not one Long March, but a series of marches, as various Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. The most well known is the march from Jiangxi province which began in October 1934. The First Front Army of the Chinese Soviet Republic, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of complete annihilation by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's troops in their stronghold in Jiangxi province. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed some 12,500 kilometers (8,000 miles) over 370 days. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi.The Long March began the ascent to power of Mao Zedong, whose leadership during the retreat gained him the support of the members of the party. The bitter struggles of the Long March, which was completed by only one-tenth of the force that left Jiangxi, would come to represent a significant episode in the history of the Communist Party of China, and would seal the personal prestige of Mao and his supporters as the new leaders of the party in the following decades. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

His theoretical contribution to Marxism-Leninism, along with his military strategies and brand of policies, are collectively known as Maoism. Mao is credited with commanding the Long March and leading the Communist Party of China (CPC) to victory against Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese Civil War, defeating an assortment of powerful regional and ethnic warlords in the process of unifying China, and helping repel a Japanese invasion. Mao also enacted sweeping land reform, by overthrowing the feudal landlords and seizing their large estates, before dividing the land up among the common people who worked it. Later, through his policies, he laid the economic, technological and cultural foundations of modern China, transforming the country from an underdeveloped peasant-based agrarian society into a major industrialized world power. However, Mao remains a controversial figure to this day, with a contentious legacy that is subject to continuing revision and fierce debate. He is officially held in high regard in China as a great political strategist, military mastermind, and savior of the nation. Additionally, he is viewed as an intellectual, poet, philosopher, and visionary. Conversely, nationwide political campaigns led by Mao, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, are blamed for millions of deaths, causing severe famine and damage to the culture, society and economy of China. Moreover, although China's population almost doubled during the period of Mao's leadership<span class="style_2">[3]</span> (from around 550 to over 900 million), his rule from 1949 to 1976 is believed to have caused the deaths of 40 to 70 million people. Despite the ongoing dispute, he is still regarded as one of the most important figures in modern world history, and was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century by Time magazine. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

These demonstrations sparked national protests and marked the upsurge of Chinese nationalism, a shift towards political mobilization and away from cultural activities, and a move towards populist base rather than intellectual elites. The broader use of the term &quot;May Fourth Movement&quot; often refers to the period during 1915-1921 more usually called the New Culture Movement. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>

Sentences typically span one to three years, with the possibility of an additional one-year extension. Re-education through labor sentences are issued by police, rather than through the judicial system. While incarcerated, detainees are often subject to some form of political education; torture, sometimes resulting in death, has also been reported in labor camps. The re-education through labor system has been in place since 1957 and was subjected to minor reforms by the Chinese government in 2007. Estimates on the number of RTL detainees on any given year ranges from 190,000 - 2 million. China Daily estimated that there were a total of 310 re-education centers in China at that time. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed July 26, 2011.)</p>
