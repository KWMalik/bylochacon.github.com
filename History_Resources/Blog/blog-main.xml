      <description>I have been haphazard in my entries here.  It is still a strange feeling to be journaling about a project in a public format.  So, until I have developed more of an idea of what I want to say, I will just let you know what is working on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, here is a list of what on the site actually has content so far (I will update you with new additions through this blog as they are completed):&lt;br/&gt;Homepage, &#x201C;Our World&#x201D;&lt;br/&gt;Links (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;Films (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;Bibliographies (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;Blog&lt;br/&gt;About Me&lt;br/&gt;Groups (podcasts and youtube have nothing, the rest have links but no descriptions)&lt;br/&gt;Events (just five initial organizations)&lt;br/&gt;Causes&lt;br/&gt;Support&lt;br/&gt;Bibliographies of the Rwandan Genocide (what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;Bibliographies of the Holocaust (what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding East Asia (links only, no descriptions yet)&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding India &amp;amp; South Asia (links only, no descriptions yet)&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Politicide in the USSR&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of the Armenian Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Personal Accounts of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Overviews of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Comparative and Introductions to Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Genocide &amp;amp; Imperialism&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Genocide &amp;amp; War&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Genocide &amp;amp; Social Revolution&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Genocide &amp;amp; Indigenous Peoples&lt;br/&gt;Bibliography of Introductions to the Holocaust&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with the Rwandan Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with the French Revolution&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Genocide in Darfur&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Genocide in General&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Genocide in East Timor&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Ethnic Cleansing in the former Yugoslavia&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Armenian Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with Cambodian Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with the Cold War&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with the USSR&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with World War II&lt;br/&gt;Films Dealing with the Holocaust&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding Comparative &amp;amp; General Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Links for Teacher Training and Teacher Organizations&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding the Rwandan Genocide&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding Human Rights and Women&lt;br/&gt;Links Regarding Africa&lt;br/&gt;Links for Websites by Teachers&lt;br/&gt;Links for Maps and General Reference&lt;br/&gt;Links by Geographic &amp;amp; Cultural Areas&lt;br/&gt;Links for Curriculum &amp;amp; Lectures&lt;br/&gt;Links for Outlines, Notes &amp;amp; Timelines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, most of these need additional sources and/or formatting.  And, for some reason, the google search on the bottom of each page does not seem to be working, so I will try and figure out what is happening and fix it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a ton of personal stuff to get done this week, like repairing my poor old corolla from its third break-in attempt this year, and trying to get some daytime sleep since my little girl is not so interested in doing that at night, but my goal is to get an introductory bibliography to the Holocaust done, to read, and to study for the GRE.  I&#x2019;m hoping that if I write it all here I will feel more accountable and stay on top of everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to thank Adam Jones, author of many books on genocide, for the invaluable lists of sources for further study and films on genocide war that he provides online and in his textbook, Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction.  These have become my starting place, and I am adding these sources to my lists first, to be built on later by myself and contributions you make.</description>

      <description>It seems that the things that take the most time in creating this project are the small, formatting tasks.  Centering, font size and style, adjusting the position of every little text box.  Hopefully its worth it - I want to make this site as easy to navigate as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that the pages for Rwandan Genocide Films and the Personal Accounts of the Rwandan Genocide are done.  Everything else is still in process.  </description>

      <description>Happy International Women&#x2019;s Day!  In honor of today, which I only happened to stumble upon thanks to the work of the &lt;a href="http://imow.org/"&gt;International Museum of Women&lt;/a&gt;, I directed my research towards collecting online resources for women&#x2019;s issues and women&#x2019;s history.  For now, they are not formatted attractively, and their descriptions are not my own, but they are listed on the page for &lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_Human_Rights_%2526_Women.html"&gt;Links - Human Rights and Women&lt;/a&gt;.  I chose this page because I believe women&#x2019;s history essentially to be a history of the struggle for human rights.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>I have never really followed through on setting up a website before, but I think that this could be a good way for me to get my head around the myriad of resources available to students of history and human rights.  I am not teaching right now, and I am not currently enrolled as a student, so I want to make sure that my brain isn&#x2019;t complete mush when I apply to programs in the fall.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First I set up all the areas I wanted on the site, and then realized I bit off way more than I could chew - initially, at least.  This project will indeed take many months.  Its already been four weeks of fairly focused work to get it to this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal is to finish all of the Rwandan Genocide sections before the end of next week, when I go down to visit my family in Ventura for a few days.  So far, the film section is ready to post, as is one of a possible sixteen bibliographies.  Just typing that makes me realize I may need more than another week.  Links are also a challenge - how much information should be on a site before I include it?  Which sites are most valid?  When should I say &#x2018;enough is enough&#x2019;, and end the list?  I suppose those are things I will have to figure out in the next week!</description>

      <description>This site is a project I have undertaken to organize web and print resources for history.  It is meant to be a first-stop for individuals seeking to understand modern history and current global issues.  I plan to develop it as a place to aggregate bibliographies, links, films, and useful downloads for teachers, students and curious individuals.  Any recommendations of related books, sites, podcasts, blogs, and events you may wish to contribute would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for visiting! </description>
