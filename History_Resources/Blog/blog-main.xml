      <description>It seems that the things that take the most time in creating this project are the small, formatting tasks.  Centering, font size and style, adjusting the position of every little text box.  Hopefully its worth it - I want to make this site as easy to navigate as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that the pages for Rwandan Genocide Films and the Personal Accounts of the Rwandan Genocide are done.  Everything else is still in process.  </description>

      <description>Happy International Women&#x2019;s Day!  In honor of today, which I only happened to stumble upon thanks to the work of the &lt;a href="http://imow.org/"&gt;International Museum of Women&lt;/a&gt;, I directed my research towards collecting online resources for women&#x2019;s issues and women&#x2019;s history.  For now, they are not formatted attractively, and their descriptions are not my own, but they are listed on the page for &lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_Human_Rights_%2526_Women.html"&gt;Links - Human Rights and Women&lt;/a&gt;.  I chose this page because I believe women&#x2019;s history essentially to be a history of the struggle for human rights.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>I have never really followed through on setting up a website before, but I think that this could be a good way for me to get my head around the myriad of resources available to students of history and human rights.  I am not teaching right now, and I am not currently enrolled as a student, so I want to make sure that my brain isn&#x2019;t complete mush when I apply to programs in the fall.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First I set up all the areas I wanted on the site, and then realized I bit off way more than I could chew - initially, at least.  This project will indeed take many months.  Its already been four weeks of fairly focused work to get it to this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal is to finish all of the Rwandan Genocide sections before the end of next week, when I go down to visit my family in Ventura for a few days.  So far, the film section is ready to post, as is one of a possible sixteen bibliographies.  Just typing that makes me realize I may need more than another week.  Links are also a challenge - how much information should be on a site before I include it?  Which sites are most valid?  When should I say &#x2018;enough is enough&#x2019;, and end the list?  I suppose those are things I will have to figure out in the next week!</description>

      <description>This site is a project I have undertaken to organize web and print resources for history.  It is meant to be a first-stop for individuals seeking to understand modern history and current global issues.  I plan to develop it as a place to aggregate bibliographies, links, films, and useful downloads for teachers, students and curious individuals.  Any recommendations of related books, sites, podcasts, blogs, and events you may wish to contribute would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for visiting! </description>
