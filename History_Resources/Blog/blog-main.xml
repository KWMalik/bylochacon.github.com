      <description>Today I am simply putting up a small list of works dealing with the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s, wars which led to a vigorous attempt at ethnic cleansing and resulted in the deaths of approximately 100,000.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recently read a book, a graphic novel, called Safe Area Gorazde.  It is listed on the &lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Ethnic_Cleansing_in_the_Former_Yugoslavia.html"&gt;Bibliography of Ethnic Cleansing in the Former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; page.  Written from the perspective of its journalist author Joe Sacco, it did a very good job at making the experiences of Muslim individuals caught in the war in Eastern Bosnia vivid and personal to a reader who has never experienced anything like that.  Sacco moved fluidly between the memories of the survivors and the present.  Using the medium of the graphic novel, he made a difficult topic readable and understandable to a lay person.  </description>

      <description>Cambodia is a place that I have wanted to travel to for a while.  The photographs are beautiful, and those who have been there talk about the warmth of the people.  There are ancient and beautiful temples and a lush, green landscape.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today I am adding a short, &#x2018;starter&#x2019;, bibliography on the Cambodian genocide. The &lt;a href="../Films_Dealing_with_the_Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Cambodian Genocide Films page&lt;/a&gt; is already up and going, and I will add more to the &lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_the_Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Cambodian Genocide Bibliography page&lt;/a&gt; as I read and understand more.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic facts are these:  Between 1975 and 1979, under the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia lost nearly two million people from starvation, forced labor, and executions.  Trials of perpetrators began only in 2006, thirty years later.</description>

      <description>I have been haphazard in my entries here.  It is still a strange feeling to be journaling about a project in a public format.  So, until I have developed more of an idea of what I want to say, I will just let you know what is working on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, here is a list of what on the site actually has content so far (I will update you with new additions through this blog as they are completed):&lt;br/&gt;Homepage, &#x201C;&lt;a href="../Our_World.html"&gt;Our World&lt;/a&gt;&#x201D;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links.html"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Films.html"&gt;Films&lt;/a&gt; (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliographies.html"&gt;Bibliographies&lt;/a&gt; (lists of what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../About_Me.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Groups.html"&gt;Groups&lt;/a&gt; (podcasts and youtube have nothing, the rest have links but no descriptions)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Events.html"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt;(just five initial organizations)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Causes.html"&gt;Causes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Support.html"&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliographies_of_the_Rwandan_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliographies of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt; (what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliographies_of_the_Holocaust.html"&gt;Bibliographies of the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; (what will be linked there)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_East_Asia.html"&gt;Links Regarding East Asia&lt;/a&gt; (links only, no descriptions yet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_India_%2526_South_Asia.html"&gt;Links Regarding India &amp;amp; South Asia&lt;/a&gt; (links only, no descriptions yet)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Politicide_in_the_USSR.html"&gt;Bibliography of Politicide in the USSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_the_Armenian_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of the Armenian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Personal_Accounts_of_the_Rwandan_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of Personal Accounts of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Overviews_of_the_Rwandan_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of Overviews of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Comparative_and_Introductions_to_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of Comparative and Introductions to Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Genocide_%2526_Imperialism.html"&gt;Bibliography of Genocide &amp;amp;

General Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_by_Geographic_%2526_Cultural_Areas.html"&gt;Links by Geographic &amp;amp; Cultural Areas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Curriculum_%2526_Lectures.html"&gt;Links for Curriculum &amp;amp; Lectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Outlines,_Notes_%2526_Timelines.html"&gt;Links for Outlines, Notes &amp;amp; Timelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, most of these need additional sources and/or formatting.  And, for some reason, the google search on the bottom of each page does not seem to be working, so I will try and figure out what is happening and fix it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have a ton of personal stuff to get done this week, like repairing my poor old corolla from its third break-in attempt this year, and trying to get some daytime sleep since my little girl is not so interested in doing that at night, but my goal is to get an introductory bibliography to the Holocaust done, to read, and to study for the GRE.  I&#x2019;m hoping that if I write it all here I will feel more accountable and stay on top of everything!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I want to thank Adam Jones, author of many books on genocide, for the invaluable lists of sources for further study and films on genocide war that he provides online and in his textbook, Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction.  These have become my starting place, and I am adding these sources to my lists first, to be built on later by myself and contributions you make.</description>

      <description>It seems that the things that take the most time in creating this project are the small, formatting tasks.  Centering, font size and style, adjusting the position of every little text box.  Hopefully its worth it - I want to make this site as easy to navigate as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that the pages for &lt;a href="../Films_Dealing_with_the_Rwandan_Genocide.html"&gt;Films Dealing with the Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Personal_Accounts_of_the_Rwandan_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of Personal Accounts of the Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt; are done.  Everything else is still in process.  </description>

      <description>Happy International Women&#x2019;s Day!  In honor of today, which I only happened to stumble upon thanks to the work of the &lt;a href="http://imow.org/"&gt;International Museum of Women&lt;/a&gt;, I directed my research towards collecting online resources for women&#x2019;s issues and women&#x2019;s history.  For now, they are not formatted attractively, and their descriptions are not my own, but they are listed on the page for &lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_Human_Rights_%2526_Women.html"&gt;Links - Human Rights and Women&lt;/a&gt;.  I chose this page because I believe women&#x2019;s history essentially to be a history of the struggle for human rights.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>I have never really followed through on setting up a website before, but I think that this could be a good way for me to get my head around the myriad of resources available to students of history and human rights.  I am not teaching right now, and I am not currently enrolled as a student, so I want to make sure that my brain isn&#x2019;t complete mush when I apply to programs in the fall.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First I set up all the areas I wanted on the site, and then realized I bit off way more than I could chew - initially, at least.  This project will indeed take many months.  Its already been four weeks of fairly focused work to get it to this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goal is to finish all of the Rwandan Genocide sections before the end of next week, when I go down to visit my family in Ventura for a few days.  So far, the film section is ready to post, as is one of a possible sixteen bibliographies.  Just typing that makes me realize I may need more than another week.  Links are also a challenge - how much information should be on a site before I include it?  Which sites are most valid?  When should I say &#x2018;enough is enough&#x2019;, and end the list?  I suppose those are things I will have to figure out in the next week!</description>

      <description>This site is a project I have undertaken to organize web and print resources for history.  It is meant to be a first-stop for individuals seeking to understand modern history and current global issues.  I plan to develop it as a place to aggregate bibliographies, links, films, and useful downloads for teachers, students and curious individuals.  Any recommendations of related books, sites, podcasts, blogs, and events you may wish to contribute would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for visiting! </description>
