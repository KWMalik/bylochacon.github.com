    <richText>Globalization links are many and time-consuming to sort through for good, reliable information.  Here are the best I have been able to find so far, but obviously, as an individual working on this list as quickly as I can, it is an imperfect list, so use with care.  &#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/68E8BA2E-D8F1-4860-9964-B6733AB0CA0E"&gt;Links Regarding Globalization&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;I apologize for the impromptu break from working on the site for the past six weeks.  I was preparing for contract employment, and of course there were the holidays and all the preparations they require.  The end result is that I am working on a European history project, and that will tilt my work on this site in that direction for the next few months.  The podcasts, coming in the next two months, will start with European history, instead of world, so that I can kill two birds with one stone.  </richText>
