    <richText>These massive killings, meant to rid the country of communist revolutionaries, were the method in which Suharto began his thirty-year rule as president of Indonesia.  More than 500,000 are estimated to have been killed, while more than a million were imprisoned at one point or another.  So far, I have only found a single monograph, listed on the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/8A552536-A926-4792-8BF8-6B7D51A5885A"&gt;Bibliography of the Indonesian Massacres&lt;/a&gt; page, but the number of sources there will undoubtedly be added to as I receive suggestions.  &#xD;</richText>
