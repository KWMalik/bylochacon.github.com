    <richText>I have changed the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/1D0E9E1B-EC2F-4918-B209-D9E72CC1C60D"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; for this site and moved it to the top menu, but it still doesn&#x2019;t seem to be working.  I&#x2019;m trying to get help repairing it, and after that will be left to repair is the RSS feed link.&#xD;&#xD;I have added a &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/5984C786-8327-4F2B-904F-DAAD8478EC06"&gt;Definitions of Killing&lt;/a&gt; page to help clear up the confusion between so many overlapping terms dealing with mass murder.  I will be adding to it and clarifying it for the future, and comments are appreciated.  Back in 2005, I made a handout on this topic for discussion in a class I was taking.  It includes examples of each, and if I&#x2019;m correct, you can download it by clicking here:  &lt;a href="Semantics%2520of%2520Mass%2520Murder.pdf"&gt;Semantics of Mass Murder.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;I have added recommendations from Pete Fredlake to the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/47B5440D-A708-4A0D-B2B6-482A83F2149E"&gt;Bibliography of Ethnic Cleansing in the Former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/5CEAA2D1-DBFD-4D79-BE6B-438F143192F6"&gt;Links for Teacher Training &amp; Organizations&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Kristyn Moravetz has recommended two books for the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/31173BA1-B2A1-4B46-BB42-592B4E4CC58A"&gt;Bibliography of Human Rights &amp; Women&lt;/a&gt;, and those have been the first additions to that list.&#xD;&#xD;My excellent former T.A., David Armstead, is working on finding information to add to the information linked to the Hate topic page.&#xD;&#xD;This weekend I was able to go Washington D.C. and touch bases with the director of the United States Holocaust Museum&#x2019;s Teacher Fellowship program, Mr. Pete Fredlake, and get some help from the Smithsonian African Art Museum&#x2019;s head librarian Dr. Janet Stanley.  Both are extremely kind and helpful, and I recommend both institutions for help with learning and teaching without reservation.&#xD;</richText>
