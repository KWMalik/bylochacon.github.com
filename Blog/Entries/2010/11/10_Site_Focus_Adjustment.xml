    <richText>It has taken me hundreds of hours to put up what is on here so far, and I know I am not close to done.  The scope of the site to this point has been too wide - a hazard of studying the history of the world.  What I have done today is remove all the human rights pages that did not yet have content, and I will leave that field to others more experienced than I.  &#xD;&#xD;Instead, I intend to focus on my areas of strength, modern world history, genocide and teaching.  Those pages are about eighty-percent finished, and will hopefully be complete by the end of the year.  234 pages with initial content, and only 68 to go!  &#xD;&#xD;As you have probably noticed, the podcast is delayed.  I have written the first two podcasts, a short introduction and one on why study history, but I am waiting on equipment, so recording probably won&#x2019;t start until the first week of the new year.  </richText>
