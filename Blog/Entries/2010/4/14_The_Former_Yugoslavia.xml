    <richText>Today I am simply putting up a small list of works dealing with the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s, wars which led to a vigorous attempt at ethnic cleansing and resulted in the deaths of approximately 100,000.  &#xD;&#xD;I recently read a book, a graphic novel, called Safe Area Gorazde.  It is listed on the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/47B5440D-A708-4A0D-B2B6-482A83F2149E"&gt;Bibliography of Ethnic Cleansing in the Former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; page.  Written from the perspective of its journalist author Joe Sacco, it did a very good job at making the experiences of Muslim individuals caught in the war in Eastern Bosnia vivid and personal to a reader who has never experienced anything like that.  Sacco moved fluidly between the memories of the survivors and the present.  Using the medium of the graphic novel, he made a difficult topic readable and understandable to a lay person.  </richText>
