    <richText>What made me start focusing on the study of genocide was teaching it.  In my first three weeks of teaching, I had put together a lecture on the Armenian genocide.  I thought, naively, that I had presented the information in a way that would interest students.  I was faced with two direct challenges:  one student raised her hand and said, &#x201C;But Mrs. Bylo, some of us just don&#x2019;t care.&#x201D;  Another, a boy raised in Turkey, laughed that I had been taken in by false claims by the Armenian community and that I obviously didn&#x2019;t have any clue what happened.&#xD;&#xD;But, these two students were not alone.  Instead they were merely representing two major problems in the history of genocide.  I have put together a small list dealing with issues in memory on the page &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/9F0CB4DE-855B-4C96-BF82-EC0C57842CB5"&gt;Bibliography of Memory &amp; Genocide&lt;/a&gt;.  Again, many thanks to Adam Jones.</richText>
