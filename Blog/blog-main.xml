      <description>My poor cats are gravely ill, and I am studying for the GRE at the end of the month, so there won&#x2019;t be many entries this month.  I have updated and added a lot of resources to the curriculum page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Curriculum.html"&gt;Links for Curriculum&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Due to the size of this site, I am listing here, &lt;a href="../Site_Guide.html"&gt;Site Guide&lt;/a&gt;, all the pages that have initial content on them and are ready for viewing.  Each page listed on the &lt;a href="../Site_Guide.html"&gt;Site Guide&lt;/a&gt; is also linked elsewhere on &lt;a href="../Our_World.html"&gt;bylochacon.com&lt;/a&gt; by topic, type of resource and blog post. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I just fixed the &lt;a href="Entries/2010/6/2_Site_Updates_files/mailto%253Abylochacon%2540gmail.com%253Fsubject%253DBylochacon.com%252520Suggestions"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; links on all the pages (I think), so it should work now.  The RSS feed is still broken, as is the google search on each page.  I&#x2019;ll work on getting those up and running as soon as I can figure out how.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I generally work on one page a day, but am continuing to add links to other pages as I find them.  If you &lt;a href="Entries/2010/6/2_Site_Updates_files/mailto%253Abylochacon%2540gmail.com%253Fsubject%253DBylochacon.com%252520Suggestions"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; suggestions, I would be happy to add them right away.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today I have finished the &lt;a href="../Links_for_History_Humor,_Fun_%2526_Games.html"&gt;Links for History Humor, Fun &amp;amp; Games&lt;/a&gt;.  Teachers, please use these resources with care, as every silly website does not have one-hundred percent student-friendly material.  &lt;br/&gt;</description>

      <description>I loved teaching high school history, but it was exhausting for me because I wanted to do everything right.  It was like swimming up river.  I spent hundreds of hours searching for resources, collecting links and books and videos, and trying to find the best stuff I could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here I have collected as many resources as I could find that are actually useful to the classroom history teacher.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated - please &lt;a href="Entries/2010/5/31_Teaching_Tools_%2526_Site_Updates_files/mailto%253Abylochacon%2540gmail.com%253Fsubject%253DTeaching"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; me with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Teaching.html"&gt;Teaching - main topic page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Teaching_Tools_%2526_Downloads.html"&gt;Teaching Tools &amp;amp; Downloads - sub-topic page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Portfolios.html"&gt;Links for Portfolios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Puzzles_%2526_Games.html"&gt;Links for Puzzles &amp;amp; Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Presentations_%2526_Lectures.html"&gt;Links for Presentations &amp;amp; Lectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Rubrics_%2526_Grading.html"&gt;Links for Rubrics &amp;amp; Grading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Calendars_%2526_Assignment_Trackers.html"&gt;Links for Calendars &amp;amp; Assignment Trackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Graphic_Organizers.html"&gt;Links for Graphic Organizers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Tests_%2526_Quizzes.html"&gt;Links for Tests &amp;amp; Quizzes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Making-Your-Own_Site,_Forums_%2526_Message_Boards.html"&gt;Links for Making-Your-Own Site, Forums &amp;amp; Message Boards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Tools_for_Teachers.html"&gt;Links for Tools for Teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Printable_Materials.html"&gt;Links for Printable Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Only two more teacher resource pages and there will be initial content on every teacher-related page!)</description>

      <description>Primary source examination is essential in the attempt to understand the past.  In addition, it makes the experiences of history more immediate and real to its students.  Primary sources don&#x2019;t have to be written documents - they can include guest speakers, photographs, videos, oral interviews, and artistic representations.  Using these sources in the classroom can enhance interest in topics as well as provide opportunity for critical analysis, writing, discussing and presenting.  I have put together a lengthy page of &lt;a href="../Links_for_Primary_Source_Guides.html"&gt;Links for Primary Source Guides&lt;/a&gt; here.  Later I will have primary sources listed more specifically by topic.  </description>

      <description>Maps can be standard political or physical representations, or they can be illustrative of things like population or which people use what kind of birth control.  They are above all, critical reference points for students.  I have put here as many good map resources as I could find, including blank political maps, scans of very old maps, and creative representations of things like the small arms trade.  You can find these sources here:  &lt;a href="../Links_for_Maps_%2526_Geography.html"&gt;Links for Maps &amp;amp; Geography&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also working on adjusting the formatting of the resources page, &lt;a href="../Teaching.html"&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;.  More is being added to &lt;a href="../Links_for_Student-Friendly_Sites.html"&gt;Links for Student-Friendly Sites&lt;/a&gt; each day as well.  Please let me know if you have any comments about the formatting, or any resources that I should add or pull.  Thank you for your help!  Since this is a one-woman operation, I need all the input I can get.</description>

      <description>Between 1904 and 1907, more than half the population of both the Herero and Nama peoples of Namibia were killed by German genocidal imperial tactics, including starvation, forced relocation, and the poisoning of well-water. I have put the few links I have found here:  &lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_the_Genocide_of_the_Herero_%2526_Nama.html"&gt;Links Regarding the Genocide of the Herero &amp;amp; Nama&lt;/a&gt;.  More scholarship is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have also added content to the teaching pages below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_General_Reference.html"&gt;Links for General Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_for_Student-Friendly_Sites.html"&gt;Links for Student-Friendly Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More is coming, just as quick as I can.  I am adding a bit to each page and then, when each page has starter content, I plan to cycle back through and flesh them out with more sources.  Someday, I may finally even add my own original work!  </description>

      <description>I believe education is key to change.  Here are some widely-accepted &lt;a href="../Definitions_of_Hate_Issues.html"&gt;Definitions of Hate Issues&lt;/a&gt;.  I have also just added the links to teacher training for anti-bias classrooms here: &lt;a href="../Links_for_Teacher_Training_in_Tolerance_%2526_Anti-Bias.html"&gt;Teacher Training in Tolerance &amp;amp; Understanding&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <description>I have just added links, of which there are many very good, very complete sites, to resources on the Cambodian Genocide.  The book list is already up, as is the films list.  The links with content for Cambodia on this site are below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Cambodian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Links_Regarding_the_Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Links Regarding the Cambodian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_the_Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Bibliography of the Cambodian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="../Films_Dealing_with_the_Cambodian_Genocide.html"&gt;Films Dealing with the Cambodian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hate Speech, Hate Groups, &amp; Hate Crimes</title>

      <description>A few years ago I saw this guy on a news broadcast as a suspect in a hate crime.  My first thought was, of course he did it - he&#x2019;s so proud of his ideology he tattooed it on his forehead!  Unfortunately, most perpetrators of hate crimes, members of hate groups and participants in hate speech are not so clearly labeled.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple weeks ago a man in my apartment building was murdered, beaten and left on the railroad tracks, because he was gay.  A number of years ago I had a transgender student who was killed in a homophobic rage.  A middle school student near my hometown was shot execution-style by another student for being gay.  These are not experiences I researched; they are events that are tangential to my life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don&#x2019;t understand how people are threatened by homosexuality.  It doesn&#x2019;t hurt my life or my marriage or my daughter in any way - how does it hurt others?  Why is it so scary?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, homosexuals are not the only targets of hate crimes, speech or language.  My multi-ethnic students could have told hundreds of times they or a friend or family member dealt with bald-faced prejudice. My former student and teacher&#x2019;s aide, David Armstead, is helping me put together information for those hurt by hate, students and teachers.  The topic page is located here:  &lt;a href="../Hate.html"&gt;Hate&lt;/a&gt;, and the first page with content is &lt;a href="../News_of_Hate.html"&gt;News of Hate&lt;/a&gt;.  Please email me with ideas of sites to add.  Thank you.  </description>

      <description>In California, tenth grade world history courses are usually begun by a review of the foundations of world civilization.  This enormous topic is then  reduced, by necessity, to a quick overview of global religions and a summary of the European Enlightenment.  I have put together a list of books on these topics, on the page &lt;a href="../Bibliography_of_Intellectual_%2526_Ethical_Foundations_of_the_Modern_Era.html"&gt;Bibliography of Intellectual &amp;amp; Ethical Foundations of the Modern Era&lt;/a&gt;, and I plan to add to it more global perspectives as I find them and as they are suggested to me.  </description>
