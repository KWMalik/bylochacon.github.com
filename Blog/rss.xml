      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://bylochacon.com/History_Resources/Blog/Entries/2010/5/31_Teaching_Tools_%26_Site_Updates_files/French-Revolution-Delacroix.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bylochacon.com/History_Resources/Blog/Media/French-Revolution-Delacroix_1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px; width:271px; height:203px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I loved teaching high school history, but it was exhausting for me because I wanted to do everything right.  It was like swimming up river.  I spent hundreds of hours searching for resources, collecting links and books and videos, and trying to find the best stuff I could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here I have collected as many resources as I could find that are actually useful to the classroom history teacher.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated - please &lt;a href=&quot;Entries/2010/5/31_Teaching_Tools_%2526_Site_Updates_files/mailto%253Abylochacon%2540gmail.com%253Fsubject%253DTeaching&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; me with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I just fixed the email links on all the pages (I think), so it should work now.  The RSS feed is still broken, as is the google search on each page.  I’ll work on getting those up and running as soon as I can.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Teaching.html&quot;&gt;Teaching - main topic page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Teaching_Tools_%2526_Downloads.html&quot;&gt;Teaching Tools &amp;amp; Downloads - sub-topic page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;Entries/2010/5/31_Teaching_Tools_%2526_Site_Updates_files/mailto%253Abylochacon%2540gmail.com%253Fsubject%253DHistory%252520Sources%252520Website&quot;&gt;E-Mail Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Portfolios.html&quot;&gt;Links for Portfolios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Puzzles_%2526_Games.html&quot;&gt;Links for Puzzles &amp;amp; Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Presentations_%2526_Lectures.html&quot;&gt;Links for Presentations &amp;amp; Lectures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Rubrics_%2526_Grading.html&quot;&gt;Links for Rubrics &amp;amp; Grading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Calendars_%2526_Assignment_Trackers.html&quot;&gt;Links for Calendars &amp;amp; Assignment Trackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Graphic_Organizers.html&quot;&gt;Links for Graphic Organizers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Tests_%2526_Quizzes.html&quot;&gt;Links for Tests &amp;amp; Quizzes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Tools_for_Teachers.html&quot;&gt;Links for Tools for Teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

In addition, it makes the experiences of history more immediate and real to its students.  Primary sources don’t have to be written documents - they can include guest speakers, photographs, videos, oral interviews, and artistic representations.  Using these sources in the classroom can enhance interest in topics as well as provide opportunity for critical analysis, writing, discussing and presenting.  I have put together a lengthy page of &lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Primary_Source_Guides.html&quot;&gt;Links for Primary Source Guides&lt;/a&gt; here.  Later I will have primary sources listed more specifically by topic.  </description>

They are above all, critical reference points for students.  I have put here as many good map resources as I could find, including blank political maps, scans of very old maps, and creative representations of things like the small arms trade.  You can find these sources here:  &lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Maps_%2526_Geography.html&quot;&gt;Links for Maps &amp;amp; Geography&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also working on adjusting the formatting of the resources page, &lt;a href=&quot;../Teaching.html&quot;&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;.  More is being added to &lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Student-Friendly_Sites.html&quot;&gt;Links for Student-Friendly Sites&lt;/a&gt; each day as well.  Please let me know if you have any comments about the formatting, or any resources that I should add or pull.  Thank you for your help!  Since this is a one-woman operation, I need all the input I can get.</description>

I have put the few links I have found here:  &lt;a href=&quot;../Links_Regarding_the_Genocide_of_the_Herero_%2526_Nama.html&quot;&gt;Links Regarding the Genocide of the Herero &amp;amp; Nama&lt;/a&gt;.  More scholarship is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have also added content to the teaching pages below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_General_Reference.html&quot;&gt;Links for General Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Student-Friendly_Sites.html&quot;&gt;Links for Student-Friendly Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More is coming, just as quick as I can.  I am adding a bit to each page and then, when each page has starter content, I plan to cycle back through and flesh them out with more sources.  Someday, I may finally even add my own original work!  </description>

My first thought was, of course he did it - he’s so proud of his ideology he tattooed it on his forehead!  Unfortunately, most perpetrators of hate crimes, members of hate groups and participants in hate speech are not so clearly labeled.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple weeks ago a man in my apartment building was murdered, beaten and left on the railroad tracks, because he was gay.  A number of years ago I had a transgender student who was killed in a homophobic rage.  A middle school student near my hometown was shot execution-style by another student for being gay.  These are not experiences I researched; they are events that are tangential to my life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don’t understand how people are threatened by homosexuality.  It doesn’t hurt my life or my marriage or my daughter in any way - how does it hurt others?  Why is it so scary?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, homosexuals are not the only targets of hate crimes, speech or language.  My multi-ethnic students could have told hundreds of times they or a friend or family member dealt with bald-faced prejudice. My former student and teacher’s aide, David Armstead, is helping me put together information for those hurt by hate, students and teachers.  The topic page is located here:  &lt;a href=&quot;../Hate.html&quot;&gt;Hate&lt;/a&gt;, and the first page with content is &lt;a href=&quot;../News_of_Hate.html&quot;&gt;News of Hate&lt;/a&gt;.  Please email me with ideas of sites to add.  Thank you.  </description>

This enormous topic is then  reduced, by necessity, to a quick overview of global religions and a summary of the European Enlightenment.  I have put together a list of books on these topics, on the page &lt;a href=&quot;../Bibliography_of_Intellectual_%2526_Ethical_Foundations_of_the_Modern_Era.html&quot;&gt;Bibliography of Intellectual &amp;amp; Ethical Foundations of the Modern Era&lt;/a&gt;, and I plan to add to it more global perspectives as I find them and as they are suggested to me.  </description>

I remembered how, as a high school student, I had learned well from lecture, but most of my classmates had not.  I hated how everyone who heard that I taught history said that it had been their least favorite class.  I wanted to be better, to help students see the impact of history on our daily lives, the danger of ignorance, and how crucial history was to understanding so many other disciplines.  History has the drama that can be found in literature, the logic that can be found in science, and the creativity that can be found in writing and arguing.  I’ve put together a list of texts that will hopefully be of use to other world history teachers here:  &lt;a href=&quot;../Bibliography_of_Teaching_History.html&quot;&gt;Bibliography of Teaching History&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’ve also updated the descriptions on the page &lt;a href=&quot;../Links_for_Teacher_Training_%2526_Organizations.html&quot;&gt;Links for Teacher Training &amp;amp; Organizations&lt;/a&gt; to reflect my experiences with each.  These are definitely the best!</description>
