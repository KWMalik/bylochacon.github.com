The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from the top of the furnace. Blast furnaces are to be contrasted with air furnaces (such as reverberatory furnaces), which were naturally aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and steel. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

There are two types of canal: 1) Waterways: navigable transportation canals used for carrying ships and boats shipping goods and conveying people. . . and 2) Aqueducts: water supply canals that are used for the conveyance and delivery of potable water for human consumption, municipal uses, and agriculture irrigation. Rills and acequias are small versions. . . The British canal system of water transport played a vital role in the United Kingdom's Industrial Revolution at a time when roads were only just emerging from the medieval mud and long trains of pack horses were the only means of &quot;mass&quot; transit by road of raw materials and finished products (it was no accident that amongst the first canal promoters were the pottery manufacturers of Staffordshire). The UK was the first country to acquire a nationwide canal network. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It takes its name from the People's Charter of 1838. Chartism was possibly the first mass working class labour movement in the world. Its leaders have often been described as either &quot;physical force&quot; or &quot;moral force&quot; leaders, depending upon their attitudes to violent protest. Chartists were largely unsuccessful at convincing Parliament to reform the voting system of the mid-19th century; however, this movement caught the interest of the working class. The working class interest in politics from that point on aided later suffrage movements. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">Child labor refers to the employment of children at regular and sustained labor. This practice is considered exploitative by many international organizations and is illegal in many countries. Child labor was employed to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the advent of universal schooling, with changes in working conditions during the industrial revolution, and with the emergence of the concepts of workers' and children's rights. . . During the Industrial Revolution, children as young as four were employed in production factories with dangerous, and often fatal, working conditions. Based on this understanding of the use of children as laborers, it is now considered by wealthy countries to be a human rights violation, and is outlawed, while some poorer countries may allow or tolerate child labour. Child labor can also be defined as the full-time employment of children who are under a minimum legal age. The Victorian era became notorious for employing young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps. Child labor played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship, Charles Dickens for example worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in debtor's prison. The children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay, earning 10-20% of an adult male's wage. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks. Children as young as three were put to work. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes. Many children (and adults) worked 16 hour days. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the &quot;Short Time Committees&quot; in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10 hour working days. An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900. In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Compared to wood fuels, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and could be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though historically used as a means of household heating, coal is now mostly used in industry, especially in smelting and alloy production, as well as electricity generation. Large-scale coal mining developed during the Industrial Revolution, and coal provided the main source of primary energy for industry and transportation in the West from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source, due to its low cost and abundance when compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation. However, coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface and is relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress. However oil and its associated fuels began to be used as alternative from this time onward. By the late 20th century coal was for the most part replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil, natural gas or electricity produced from oil, gas, nuclear power or renewable energy sources. Since 1890, coal mining has also been a political and social issue. Coal miners' labour and trade unions became powerful in many countries in the 20th century, and often the miners were leaders of the Left or Socialist movements (as in Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, Canada and the U.S.) Since 1970, environmental issues have been increasingly important, including the health of miners, destruction of the landscape from strip mines and mountaintop removal, air pollution, and coal combustion's contribution to global warming. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824. Lobbying by the radical tailor Francis Place played a role in this.

The term originally referred to home workers who were engaged in a task such as sewing, lace-making or household manufacturing. Some industries which are usually operated from large centralized factories were cottage industries before the Industrial Revolution. Business operators would travel around, buying raw materials, delivering them to people who would work on them, and then collecting the finished goods to sell, or typically to ship to another market. One of the factors which allowed the Industrial Revolution to take place in Western Europe was the presence of these business people who had the ability to expand the scale of their operations. Cottage industries were very common in the time when a large proportion of the population was engaged in agriculture, because the farmers (and their families) often had both the time and the desire to earn additional income during the part of the year (winter) when there was little farming work to do. The use of the term has expanded, and is used to refer to any event which allows a large number of people to work part time. For example, eBay is said to have spawned a cottage industry of people who buy surplus merchandise, and sell it on their auction system. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Typically built between 1775 and 1930, mills spun cotton which was an important product during the Industrial Revolution. Cotton mills, and the mechanization of the spinning process, were instrumental in the growth of the machine tool industry, enabling the construction of larger cotton mills. The requirement for water helped stimulate the construction of the canal system, and the need for power the development of steam engines. Limited companies were developed to construct the mills. This led to the trading floors of the cotton exchange of Manchester, which in its turn created a vast commercial city. The mills also created extra employment, leading to the expansion of local populations and the need for extra housing. In response, mill towns with municipal governments were created. The mills provided independent incomes for girls and women. Child labour was used in the mills, and the factory system led to organized labor. Poor conditions in cotton mills became the subject of exposes and the Factory Acts were written to regulate them. The cotton mill was originally a Lancashire phenomenon that then was copied in New England and later in the southern states of America. In the 20th century, North West England lost its supremacy to the United States, then India and then China. In the 21st century redundant mills have been accepted as part of a country's industrial heritage. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

If the value of an area's goods and services is higher in one year than the year before, it experiences positive growth, usually simply called &quot;economic growth.&quot; In a year when less value than the year before is produced and sold, it experiences &quot;negative economic growth,&quot; also called &quot;recession&quot; or &quot;depression.&quot; Economic growth can occur due to an increase in the number of goods or services. It can also occur due to production of more expensive goods and services. For example, often as people become wealthier, the types of food that they want change. While individuals may not eat more food, they may reduce the amount of pasta and potatoes they eat and may increase amounts of more expensive foods like meat and dairy. Meeting these changes in consumer demand could create an increase in the value of goods produced and thus, economic growth. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Once enclosed, these uses of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceases to be common land. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (<span class="style_2">enclosed</span>) and <span class="style_2">deeded</span> or <span class="style_2">entitled</span> to one or more owners. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands. &quot;Enclosure&quot; is the modern spelling, while &quot;inclosure&quot; is an older spelling still used in the United Kingdom in legal documents and place names. The process of enclosure has sometimes been accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England. Marxist and neo-Marxist historians argue that rich landowners used their control of state processes to appropriate public land for their private benefit. This created a landless working class that provided the labour required in the new industries developing in the north of England. For example: &quot;In agriculture the years between 1760 and 1820 are the years of wholesale enclosure in which, in village after village, common rights are lost&quot;. &quot;Enclosure (when all the sophistications are allowed for) was a plain enough case of class robbery&quot;. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

'Factors of production' may also refer specifically to the primary factors, which are stocks including land, labor (the ability to work), and capital goods applied to production. The primary factors facilitate production but neither become part of the product (as with raw materials) nor become significantly transformed by the production process (as with fuel used to power machinery). 'Land' includes not only the site of production but natural resources above or below the soil. Recent usage has distinguished human capital (the stock of knowledge in the labor force) from labor. Entrepreneurship is also sometimes considered a factor of production. Sometimes the overall state of technology is described as a factor of production. The number and definition of factors varies, depending on theoretical purpose, empirical emphasis, or school of economics. Differences are most stark when it comes to deciding which factor is the most important. For example, in the Austrian view—often shared by neoclassical and other &quot;free market&quot; economists—the primary factor of production is the time of the entrepreneur, which, when combined with other factors, determines the amount of output of a particular good or service. However, other authors argue that &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; is nothing but a specific kind of labor or human capital and should not be treated separately. The Marxian school goes further, seeing labor (in general, including entrepreneurship) as the primary factor of production, since it is required to produce capital goods and to utilize the gifts of nature. But this debate is more about basic economic theory (the role of the factors in the economy) than it is about the definition of the factors of production. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The first aim of the movement was for a &quot;ten hours bill&quot; to limit to ten hours the working day of children.

For example, a car sold to a consumer is a final good; the components such as tires sold to the car manufacturer are not; they are intermediate goods used to make the final good. When used in measures of national income and output the term final goods only includes new goods. For instance, the GDP excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent double counting of production based on resales of the same item second and third hand.

It was patented by John Kay (1704–1764) in 1733. It was controlled by a lever and only one weaver had control of this motion. As prior to this invention weavers used to weave by hand and could only weave a fabric no wider than an arms length. If this length exceeded the maximum, two people would do the task of one but the flying shuttle could weave much wider than an arms length at much greater speeds. . . The increase in production due to the flying shuttle exceeded the capacity of the spinning industry of the day, and prompted development of powered spinning machines, beginning with the spinning jenny and the waterframe, and culminating in the spinning mule, which could produce strong, fine thread in the quantities needed. These innovations transformed the textile industry in Great Britain. All were attacked as threats to the livelihood of spinners and weavers, and Kay's patent was largely ignored. It is often incorrectly written that Kay was attacked and fled to France, but in fact he simply moved there to attempt to rent out his looms, a business model that had failed him in England. The flying shuttle itself produced a new source of injuries; if deflected from its path, it could be shot clear of the machine, potentially striking workers. Turn of the century injury reports abound with instances in which eyes were lost or other injuries sustained, and in several instances (for example, an extended exchange in 1901) the British House of Commons was moved to take up the issue of installing guards and other contrivances to reduce these injuries. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It was the first in a series of World's Fair exhibitions of culture and industry that were to become a popular 19th-century feature. The Great Exhibition was organized by Henry Cole and Prince Albert, the spouse of the reigning monarch, Queen Victoria.

For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various nationalist movements as Ireland was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as &quot;pre-Famine&quot;. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Prior to the development of electric power, hydropower was used for irrigation, and operation of various machines, such as watermills, textile machines, sawmills, dock cranes, and domestic lifts. Another method used a trompe to produce compressed air from falling water, which could then be used to power other machinery at a distance from the water. In hydrology, hydropower is manifested in the force of the water on the riverbed and banks of a river. It is particularly powerful when the river is in flood. The force of the water results in the removal of sediment and other materials from the riverbed and banks of the river, causing erosion and other alterations. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Industrial Revolution was a period from the 18th to the 19th century where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the United Kingdom, then subsequently spread throughout Europe, North America, and eventually the world. The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Most notably, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. In the two centuries following 1800, the world's average per capita income increased over 10-fold, while the world's population increased over 6-fold. In the words of Nobel Prize winner Robert E. Lucas, Jr., &quot;For the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth. ... Nothing remotely like this economic behavior has happened before.&quot; Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal–based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanization of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads and railways. The introduction of steam power fueled primarily by coal, wider utilization of water wheels and powered machinery (mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as industrialization. The impact of this change on society was enormous. The First Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th century, merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships, railways, and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine and electrical power generation. The period of time covered by the Industrial Revolution varies with different historians. Eric Hobsbawm held that it 'broke out' in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830. Some 20th century historians such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts have argued that the process of economic and social change took place gradually and the term <span class="style_2">revolution</span> is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among historians. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy. The Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants. . .The industrial revolution changed the nature of work and society. Opinion varies as to the exact date, but it is estimated that the First Industrial Revolution took place between 1750 and 1850, and the second phase or Second Industrial Revolution between 1860 and 1900. The three key drivers in these changes were textile manufacturing, iron founding and steam power. . . Historians agree that the Industrial Revolution was one of the most important events in history. . . The Industrial Revolution is the period encompassing the vast social and economic changes that resulted from the development of steam-powered machinery and mass-production methods, beginning in about 1760 in Great Britain and extending through the first half of the nineteenth century. The lives of large sections of the population of Great Britain underwent massive changes during the industrial revolution. Work became more regimented and disciplined, and began to take place outside the home. Many of the jobs, especially in the textile industry, could now be done by common laborers, or even children, rather than skilled tradesmen, and was closely supervised. A movement of the population to the cities from the countryside produced dramatic changes in lifestyle. Resistance to the changes in the form of machine-breaking riots and other Luddite actions was widespread, but ultimately futile. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The agreements negotiated by the union leaders are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Originating in Europe, trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution, when the lack of skill necessary to perform most jobs shifted employment bargaining power almost completely to the employers' side, causing many workers to be mistreated and underpaid. Trade union organizations may be composed of individual workers, professionals, past workers, or the unemployed. The most common, but by no means only, purpose of these organizations is &quot;maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment&quot;. Over the last three hundred years, many trade unions have developed into a number of forms, influenced by differing political objectives. Activities of trade unions vary, but may include: 1) Provision of benefits to members: Early trade unions, like Friendly Societies, often provided a range of benefits to insure members against unemployment, ill health, old age and funeral expenses. In many developed countries, these functions have been assumed by the state; however, the provision of professional training, legal advice and representation for members is still an important benefit of trade union membership. 2) Collective bargaining: Where trade unions are able to operate openly and are recognized by employers, they may negotiate with employers over wages and working conditions. 3) Industrial action: Trade unions may enforce strikes or resistance to lockouts in furtherance of particular goals. 4) Political activity: Trade unions may promote legislation favorable to the interests of their members or workers as a whole. To this end they may pursue campaigns, undertake lobbying, or financially support individual candidates or parties (such as the Labour Party in Britain) for public office. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The building or facility in which a toll is collected may be called a toll booth, toll house, toll plaza, toll station, toll bar or toll gate. This building is usually found near exits, at the beginning or end of bridges, and when you enter a tolled highway. . . Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom were bodies set up by Act of Parliament, with powers to collect road tolls for maintaining the principal highways in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries. (wikipedia.org.

They are made to specifications that ensure that they are so nearly identical that they will fit into any device of the same type. One such part can freely replace another, without any custom fitting (such as filing). This interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the person doing the assembly or repair. The concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the assembly line at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become a ubiquitous element of modern manufacturing. Interchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and machine tools. These innovations included invention of new machine tools, jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts. Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible. Modern machines tools often have numerical control (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available. Harder steels for cutting edges were developed which allowed steel rather than iron to be used for parts, eliminating the problem of warping and dimensional changes associated with heat treatment hardening of iron parts after machining. Modern cutting edges use materials such as tungsten carbide. Other innovations were drop forging and stamped steel parts, which reduced or eliminated the amount of machining. The system for producing interchangeable parts is alternately called <span class="style_2">The American system of manufacturing</span> because it was first most fully developed in the US, although contributions were made by other nations who soon implemented it. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

In the United States it was New England. Prior to the 17th century, the manufacture of goods was performed on a limited scale by individual workers. This was usually on their own premises (such as weavers' cottages) – and goods were transported around the country by horse, or by river. River navigations has been constructed, and some contour following canals, and, in the early 18th century, artisans were inventing ways to become more productive. Silk, Wool, Fustian, were being eclipsed by Cotton which was becoming the most important textile. . . Textile manufacturing [today] is a major industry. It is based in the conversion of three types of fiber into yarn, then fabric, then textiles. These are then fabricated into clothes or other artifacts. Cotton remains the most important natural fiber, so is treated in depth. There are many variable processes available at the spinning and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the finishing and coloration processes to the production of a wide ranges of products. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

In an internal combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and -pressure gases produced by combustion applies direct force to some component of the engine, such as pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, generating useful mechanical energy. The term <span class="style_2">internal combustion engine</span> usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described. The internal combustion engine (or ICE) is quite different from external combustion engines, such as steam or Stirling engines, in which the energy is delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by combustion products. Working fluids can be air, hot water, pressurized water or even liquid sodium, heated in some kind of boiler. A large number of different designs for ICEs have been developed and built, with a variety of different strengths and weaknesses. Powered by an energy-dense fuel (which is very frequently gasoline, a liquid derived from fossil fuels). While there have been and still are many stationary applications, the real strength of internal combustion engines is in mobile applications and they dominate as a power supply for cars, aircraft, and boats. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Although it was not the only such &quot;mission&quot;, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck and was probably based on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I. The Iwakura mission followed several such missions previously sent by the Shogunate, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860), the First Japanese Embassy to Europe (1862), and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (1863). (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Labor markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labor economics looks at the suppliers of labor services (workers), the demanders of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. In economics, labor is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital. There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also counter posing macro-economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Lathes can be used to shape pottery, the best-known design being the potter's wheel. Most suitably equipped metalworking lathes can also be used to produce most solids of revolution, plane surfaces and screw threads or helices. Ornamental lathes can produce three-dimensional solids of incredible complexity. The material can be held in place by either one or two <span class="style_2">centers</span>, at least one of which can be moved horizontally to accommodate varying material lengths. Other workholding methods include clamping the work about the axis of rotation using a chuck or collet, or to a faceplate, using clamps or dogs. Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include candlestick holders, cue sticks, table legs, bowls, baseball bats, musical instruments (especially woodwind instruments), crankshafts and camshafts. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The law suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others. In the terminology of the law, the <span class="style_2">head start</span>, initially an advantage, subsequently becomes a <span class="style_2">handicap</span>. . . The most noted example of the law was seen in 19th century England, which was at the forefront of the industrial revolution; the technology and infrastructure installed at the time later became a hindrance to further modernization. Conversely, countries like Japan and the Soviet Union, being industrial latecomers, were able to adopt the latest industrial technologies with little disruption from, and to, their existing infrastructure. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The line opened on 15 September 1830 and ran between the cities of Liverpool and Manchester in North West England in the United Kingdom. The L&amp;MR was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials and finished goods between the Port of Liverpool and mills in Manchester and surrounding towns. In 1845, the L&amp;MR was absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR formed part of the London and North Western Railway. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

All machine tools involve some kind of fundamental constraining and guiding of movement provided by the parts of the machine, such that the relative movement between workpiece and cutting tool (which is called the toolpath) is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent, rather than being entirely &quot;offhand&quot; or &quot;freehand&quot;. Machine tools archetypically perform conventional machining or grinding on metal (that is, metal cutting by shear deformation, producing swarf), but the definition can no longer be limited to those elements, if it ever could, because other processes than machining may apply, and other workpiece materials than metal are common. The precise definition of the term varies among users, as detailed in the &quot;Nomenclature and key concepts&quot; section. It is safe to say that all machine tools are &quot;machines that help people to make things&quot;, although not all factory machines are machine tools. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

This includes the classical factors of production minus financial capital and minus human capital. They include two broad categories of objects: <span class="style_2">instruments of labor</span> (tools, factories, infrastructure, <span class="style_2">etc.</span>) and <span class="style_2">subjects of labor</span> (natural resources and raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labour, using the instruments of labor, to create a product; or, stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a product. When used in the broad sense, the &quot;means of production&quot; includes the &quot;means of distribution&quot; which includes stores, banks, and railroads. The term can be simply and picturesquely described in an agrarian society as the soil and the shovel; in an industrial society, the mines and the factories. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It can also refer to the use of machines to replace human labor or animal labor. A step beyond mechanization is automation. Even the use of manually powered tools is an example of mechanization as it reduces the work of either screwing, drilling, inserting nails, punching, or even washing a surface. . . The term is most often used in industry. The addition of powered machine tools, such as the steam powered lathe, dramatically reduced the amount of time needed to carry out various tasks, and improved productivity. Today very little commercial construction or manufacturing is carried out solely with hand tools. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

James Watt's later engine was an improved version. Although Watt is far more famous today, Newcomen rightly deserves the first credit for the widespread introduction of steam power. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims defining the invention which must be new, non-obvious, and useful or industrially applicable. In many countries, certain subject areas are excluded from patents, such as business methods, treatment of the human body, and mental acts. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission. It is just a right to prevent others' use. A patent does not give the proprietor of the patent the right to <span class="style_2">use</span> the patented invention, should it fall within the scope of an earlier patent. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It was most commonly seen in workers in the match industry in the 19th and early 20th century. Modern occupational hygiene practices have eliminated the working conditions which caused this disease. . . Those with phossy jaw would begin suffering painful toothaches and swelling of the gums. Over time, the jaw bone would begin to abscess. Affected bones would glow a greenish-white color in the dark. It also caused serious brain damage. Surgical removal of the afflicted jaw bones could save the patient; otherwise, death from organ failure would follow. The disease was extremely painful and disfiguring to the patient, with dying bone tissue rotting away accompanied by a foul-smelling discharge. . . White phosphorus was the active ingredient of most matches from the 1840s to the 1910s and exposure to the vapor from this caused a deposition of phosphorus in the jaw bones of workers in the industry. Concern over phossy jaw contributed to the London matchgirls strike of 1888, and although this strike did not end the use of white phosphorus, William Booth and the Salvation Army opened a match-making factory in 1891 which used the much safer, though more expensive, red phosphorus. The Salvation Army also campaigned with local retailers to get them to sell only red phosphorus matches. However it was not until the use of white phosphorus was prohibited by the international Berne Convention in 1906, and these provisions were implemented in national laws over the next few years, that industrial use ceased. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5–4.5%, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. The traditional shape of the molds used for these ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or <span class="style_2">runner.</span> Such a configuration is similar in appearance to a litter of piglets suckling on a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the <span class="style_2">pigs</span>) were simply broken from the much thinner runner (the <span class="style_2">sow</span>), hence the name <span class="style_2">pig iron</span>. As pig iron is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and inclusion of small amounts of sand was insignificant compared to the ease of casting and of handling.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The original edition was in German. Considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general, the book was translated into English for the first time by Talcott Parsons and appeared in 1930. In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism. This idea is also known as &quot;the Weber thesis&quot;. Weber, however, rejected deterministic approaches, and presented the Protestant Ethic as merely one in a number of 'elective affinities' leading toward capitalist modernity. Weber's term Protestant work ethic has become very widely known. The work relates significantly to the cultural &quot;rationalization&quot; and so-called &quot;disenchantment&quot; which Weber associated with the modern West. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

According to its preamble, the act was designed to &quot;take effectual Measures for correcting divers Abuses that have long prevailed in the Choice of Members to serve in the Commons House of Parliament.&quot; Calls for reform had been mooted long before 1832, but perennially without success. The Act which finally succeeded was proposed by the Whigs led by the Prime Minister Lord Grey. It met with significant opposition from the Pittite factions in Parliament that had governed the country for so long (opposition was especially pronounced in the House of Lords). Nevertheless, as a result of public pressure, the bill was eventually passed. The Act granted seats in the House of Commons to large cities that had sprung up during the Industrial Revolution, and took away seats from the &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;—those with very small populations. The Act also increased the number of individuals entitled to vote, increasing the size of the electorate from about 400,000 to 650,000, and allowing a total of one out of six adult males to vote, in a population of some 14 million. The full title is <span class="style_2">An Act to amend the representation of the people in England and Wales</span>. Its formal short title and citation is the Representation of the People Act 1832. The Act only applied in England and Wales; separate reform bills were passed in the same year for Scotland and Ireland. Other reform measures were passed later during the 19th century; as a result, the Reform Act 1832 is sometimes called the First, or Great Reform Act. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It elevated folk art and ancient custom to something noble, made of spontaneity a desirable character (as in the musical impromptu), and argued for a &quot;natural&quot; epistemology of human activities as conditioned by nature in the form of language and customary usage. Romanticism reached beyond the rational and Classicist ideal models to elevate a revived medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl, and industrialism, and it also attempted to embrace the exotic, unfamiliar, and distant in modes more authentic than Rococo <span class="style_2">chinoiserie</span>, harnessing the power of the imagination to envision and to escape. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

In a workplace setting, sabotage is the conscious withdrawal of efficiency generally directed at causing some change in workplace conditions. One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur. As a rule, saboteurs try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions. For example, whereas an environmental pressure group might be happy to be identified with an act of sabotage, it would not want the individual identities of the perpetrators known. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It is considered to have begun with Bessemer steel in the 1860s and culminated in mass production and the production line. The Second Industrial Revolution saw rapid industrial development in Western Europe (Britain, Germany, France, the Low Countries, Denmark), the United States (Northeast and Great Lakes) and, after 1870, in Japan. It followed on from the First Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the late 18th century that then spread throughout Western Europe and North America. The concept was introduced by Patrick Geddes, <span class="style_2">Cities in Evolution</span> (1915), but David Landes's use of the term in a 1966 essay and in <span class="style_2">The Unbound Prometheus</span> (1972) standardized scholarly definitions of the term, which was most intensely promoted by American historian Alfred Chandler (1918–2007). However some continue to express reservations about its use. Landes (20) stresses the importance of new technologies, especially electricity, the internal combustion engine, new materials and substances, including alloys and chemicals, and communication technologies such as the telegraph and radio. While the first was centered on iron, and steam technologies and textile production, the second revolved around steel, railroads, electricity, and chemicals. Vaclav Smill called the period 1867–1914 &quot;The Age of Synergy&quot; during which most of the great innovations were developed. Unlike the First Industrial Revolution, the inventions and innovations were science based. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by hand. Besides being wasteful, planting was very imprecise and led to a poor distribution of seeds, leading to low productivity. The use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield by as much as eight times. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft. The simplest shuttles, known as &quot;stick shuttles&quot;, are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns. Shuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood, because it is so hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish. Originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand. However, John Kay invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a flying shuttle. This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

This includes iron extraction from iron ore, and copper extraction and other base metals from their ores. Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to change the oxidation state of the metal ore; the reducing agent is commonly a source of carbon such as coke, or in earlier times charcoal. The carbon or carbon monoxide derived from it removes oxygen from the ore to leave the metal. The carbon is thus oxidized in two stages, producing first carbon monoxide and then carbon dioxide. As most ores are impure, it is often necessary to use flux, such as limestone, to remove the accompanying rock gangue as slag. Plants for the electrolytic reduction of aluminum are also generally referred to as smelters. These do not melt aluminum oxide but instead dissolve it in aluminum fluoride. They normally use carbon electrodes, and conversion of carbon to carbon dioxide provides an important part of deoxydation energy, rest of energy being provided by electricity, but novel smelter designs use electrodes that are not consumed in the process. The end product is molten aluminum. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It was invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill, Oswaldtwistle near Blackburn, Lancashire in England. The device reduced the amount of work needed to produce yarn, with a worker able to work eight or more spools at once. This grew to 120 as technology advanced. . . The Spinning Jenny is attributed to James Hargreaves. He was born in Oswaldtwistle, near Blackburn, around 1720. Blackburn, was a town with a population of about 5,000, known for the production of &quot;Blackburn greys,&quot; cloths of linen warp and cotton weft. They were usually sent to London to be printed. At the time cotton production could not keep up with demand, and Hargreaves spent some time considering how to improve the process. The flying shuttle had increased yarn demand by the weavers by doubling their productivity, and now the spinning jenny could supply that demand by increasing the spinners' productivity even more. The machine produced coarse yarn.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Mules were worked in pairs by a minder, with the help of two boys: the little piecer and the big or side piecer. The carriage carried up to 1320 spindles and could be 150 feet (46 m) long, and would move forward and back a distance of 5 feet (1.5 m) four times a minute. It was invented between 1775–1779 by Samuel Crompton. The self acting (automatic) mule was patented by Richard Roberts in 1825. At its peak there were 50,000,000 mule spindles in Lancashire alone. The spinning mule spins textile fiber into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; on the return it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

While ongoing disagreement about exact stages exists, many economists (notable Marx and others following from his critique of capitalism) have posited the following general states: 1) An <span class="style_3">agrarian capitalism</span>, sometimes known as market feudalism. This was a transitional form between feudalism and capitalism, whereby market relations replaced some but not all of feudal relations in a society. 2) <span class="style_3">Mercantilism</span>, where national governments sought to maintain positive balances of trade and acquire gold bullion 3) <span class="style_3">Industrial Capitalism</span>, characterized by its use of heavy machinery, a much more pronounced division of labor, and Taylorism. 4) <span class="style_3">Monopoly Capitalism</span>, marked by the rise of monopolies and trusts dominating industry, as well as other aspects of society. Often used to describe the economy of the late 19th and early 20th century. 5) <span class="style_3">Colonialism</span>, where governments sought to colonize other areas to improve access to markets and raw materials, and improve the standing of nationally based capitalist firms. Predominant in the 1890s, notably as a response to the economic crises of the 1890s. 6) <span class="style_3">Welfare Capitalism</span>, where mixed economies predominated and governments sought to provide a safety net to alleviate the worst abuses of capitalism. Can mark its starting point with Otto Von Bismarck providing social insurance as a method to head off support for socialism in the 1880s. The heyday of welfare capitalism (in advanced economies) is widely seen to be from 1945–1973, as major social safety nets were put in place in most advanced capitalist economies. 7) <span class="style_3">Mass Production</span>, post-World War Two, saw the rising hegemony of major corporations, and a focus on mass production, mass consumption, and (ideally) mass employment. This stage sees the rise of advertising as a way to promote mass consumption, and often sees significant economic planning taking place within firms. 8) <span class="style_3">State Capitalism</span>, where the state intervened to prevent economic instability, including partially or fully nationalizing certain industries. Some economic planning (like the type done by the Japanese MITI) may occur here. Some socialists characterize the economies of the USSR and the Eastern Block to have fallen in this category as well. 9) <span class="style_3">Corporatism</span>, where government, business, and labor collude to make major national decisions; notable for being an economic model of fascism; can overlap with, but is still significantly different from state capitalism. 10) <span class="style_3">Financialization</span>, or financial capitalism, where financial parts of the economy (like the finance, insurance, or real estate sectors predominate an economy. Profit becomes more derived from ownership of an asset, credit, rents, and earning interest, rather than actual productive processes. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Established in 1870 as a corporation in Ohio, it was the largest oil refiner in the world and operated as a major company trust and was one of the world's first and largest multinational corporations until it was broken up by the United States Supreme Court in 1911. John D. Rockefeller was a founder, chairman and major shareholder. As it grew exponentially and engaged in business strategies, tactics and practices that were lawful but drove many smaller businesses under, Standard Oil became widely criticized in the public eye, even as it made Rockefeller the richest man in modern history. Other notable Standard Oil principals include Henry Flagler, developer of Florida's Florida East Coast Railway and resort cities, and Henry H. Rogers, who built the Virginian Railway (VGN), a well-engineered highly efficient line dedicated to shipping southern West Virginia's bituminous coal to port at Hampton Roads. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">A steamboat or steamship, sometimes called a steamer, is a ship in which the primary method of propulsion is steam power, typically driving propellers or paddlewheels. Steamships usually use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S. The term steamboat is usually used to refer to smaller steam-powered boats working on lakes and rivers, particularly riverboats; steamship generally refers to larger steam-powered ships, usually ocean-going, capable of carrying a (ship's) boat. The term steam wheeler is archaic and rarely used. In England, &quot;steam packet&quot;, after its sailing predecessor, was the usual term; even &quot;steam barge&quot; could be used, especially in newspaper reports. Steam engines were developed and adapted in the late 18th century for use on ships, but did not become widely used until the early 19th century. Growth in their use was rapid on United States rivers, and seaworthy steamships gradually replaced sailing ships for commercial shipping through the latter 19th century. During that period even the largest of steamships had auxiliary sails. The French transatlantic steamer &quot;La Touraine&quot; was probably the last of her type to be equipped with sails, although she never used them. Steamships in turn were overtaken by diesel-driven ships in the second half of the 20th century. Most warships used steam propulsion from the 1860s until the advent of the gas turbine in the early 20th century. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used. The heat cycle is known as the Rankine cycle. The water turns to steam in a boiler and expands greatly in volume, and can be used to generate mechanical power, usually via pistons or turbines. The steam is then usually cooled to condense it, and it is pumped back into the boiler. The idea of using boiling water to produce mechanical motion has a long history, going back about 2,000 years. Early devices were not practical power producers, but more advanced designs producing usable power have become a major source of mechanical power over the last 300 years, beginning with applications for removing water from mines using vacuum engines. Subsequent developments using pressurized steam and converting linear to rotational motion enabled the powering of a wide range of manufacturing machinery. This could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained, whereas previous installations were limited to locations where water wheels or windmills could be used. Significantly, this power source would later be applied to prime movers, mobile devices such as steam tractors and railway locomotives. Modern steam turbines generate about 80% of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. In general usage, the term 'steam engine' can refer to integrated steam plants such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine. Specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

This may also include a <span class="style_2">road locomotive</span> such as a traction engine or steam car, however when the term is used on its own, it commonly refers to a railway locomotive. Its purpose is to haul a train of freight wagons or passenger coaches along a railway track. The locomotive is usually fueled by coal, wood or oil. This fuel is burned to produce steam in a boiler, which drives the steam engine. Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons pulled behind. Beginning in Britain, steam locomotives dominated railway transportation from the start of the 19th century, until the middle of the 20th century. They were gradually improved and developed in their over 150 years of use. Starting in about 1930, other types of engines were developed, and steam locomotives were gradually superseded by diesel and electric locomotives. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Its first use was to pump water from mines. The early steam engines were not very efficient, but a double-acting rotative version created by James Watt gave engines the power to become a driving force behind the Industrial Revolution. Steam power was not only used in engines but also in locomotives, furnaces and other factory appliances that were difficult to implement prior to the invention of steam power. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Carbon is the most common alloying material for iron, but various other alloying elements are used, such as manganese, chromium, vanadium, and tungsten. Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the iron atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying elements and the form of their presence in the steel (solute elements, precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. Steel with increased carbon content can be made harder and stronger than iron, but such steel is also less ductile than iron. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It was 26 miles (40 km) long, and was built in north-eastern England between Witton Park and Stockton-on-Tees via Darlington, and connected to several collieries near Shildon. Planned to carry both goods and passengers, the line was initially built to connect inland coal mines to Stockton, where coal was to be loaded onto sea-going boats. Much of its route is now served by the Tees Valley Line, operated by Northern Rail. It was also the longest railway at the time. Over the next 38 years it steadily expanded into a substantial network serving south and west Durham, Cleveland and Westmorland, and running trains across Cumberland to within a few miles of the west coast. It was taken over by the North Eastern Railway in 1863, but by agreement continued to operate independently for a further 10 years. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

A strike usually takes place in response to employee grievances. Strikes became important during the industrial revolution, when mass labor became important in factories and mines. In most countries, they were quickly made illegal, as factory owners had far more political power than workers. Most western countries partially legalized striking in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Strikes are sometimes used to put pressure on governments to change policies. Occasionally, strikes destabilize the rule of a particular political party or ruler. In such cases strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Captain Swing did not actually exist but was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the movement. The &quot;Swing letters&quot; were first mentioned by <span class="style_2">The Times</span>, newspaper on the 21 October 1830. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It is spread through the air when people who have an active MTB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit their saliva through the air. Most infections in humans result in an asymptomatic, latent infection, and about one in ten latent infections eventually progresses to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of its victims. The classic symptoms are a chronic cough with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss (the last giving rise to the formerly prevalent colloquial term &quot;consumption&quot;). Infection of other organs causes a wide range of symptoms. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Urbanization is also defined by the United Nations as movement of people from rural to urban areas with population growth equating to urban migration. The United Nations projected that half of the world's population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008. Urbanization is closely linked to modernization, industrialization, and the sociological process of rationalization. Urbanization can describe a specific condition at a set time, i.e. the proportion of total population or area in cities or towns, or the term can describe the increase of this proportion over time. So the term urbanization can represent the level of urban relative to overall population, or it can represent the rate at which the urban proportion is increasing. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

It is distinguished from later socialist thought by being based on idealism instead of materialism. Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label &quot;utopian&quot; by later socialists to convey negative attitudes and naivete to dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic. Religious sects whose members live communally, such as the Hutterites, for example, are not usually called &quot;utopian socialists&quot;, although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as religious socialists by some. Likewise, intentional communities based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as &quot;utopian socialist&quot;. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Weaving was &quot;put out&quot; to surrounding villagers. The Waltham-Lowell System saw all stages of textile production done under one roof, with employees living in company housing, and away from home and family. The system used domestic labor, often referred to as mill girls, who came to the new textile centers from rural towns to earn more money than was possible at home, and to live a cultured life in &quot;the city&quot;. They lived a very regimented life - they lived in company boardinghouses and were held to strict hours and a rigid moral code. As competition in the domestic textile industry increased and wages subsequently fell, strikes began to occur, and with the introduction of cheaper imported foreign workers by mid-century, the system proved unprofitable and declined. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Both are credited to Richard Arkwright who patented the technology in 1768. It was based on an invention by Thomas Highs and the patent was later overturned. John Kay, a clock maker and mechanic who helped Highs build the spinning frame, sold the design to Arkwright (for what might be considered a derisory sum). It was Arkwright, however, who made the system work, realizing that account had to be taken of the fiber lengths in the batch being spun. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. Water wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century, but they are no longer in common use. Prior uses of water wheels include milling flour in gristmills and grinding wood into pulp for paper making, but other uses include foundry work and machining, and pounding linen for use in the manufacture of paper. Some water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond, which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed. A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a mill race (also spelled millrace) or simply a &quot;race&quot;, and is customarily divided into sections. The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a headrace; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace. The main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water, which limits where they can be located. Modern hydroelectric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

Improving on the design of the 1712 Newcomen engine, the Watt steam engine, developed sporadically from 1763 to 1775, was the next great step in the development of the steam engine. Offering a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency, the new design replaced Newcomen engines in areas where coal was expensive, and then went on to be used in the place of most natural power sources such as wind and water. James Watt's design became synonymous with steam engines, due in no small part to his business partner, Matthew Boulton. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

The term was the usual word in England, Wales, and Ireland for the institution more commonly known in Scotland as a poorhouse. Its earliest known use dates from 1631, in an account by the mayor of Abingdon in which he reports that &quot;wee haue erected wthn our borough a workehouse to sett poore people to worke&quot;. The workhouse was colloquially known as 'The Spike' as a reference to the spikes used by the inmates to pick oakum, also specifically the casual ward of a workhouse. Although small numbers of workhouses were established in other European countries, the system was most highly developed in England. Holland, for instance, had three large workhouses for the entire country, whereas the English county of Cheshire alone had 31 by 1777. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>

This is what gives it a &quot;grain&quot; resembling wood, which is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure. Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile and easily welded. Historically, it was known as &quot;commercially pure iron&quot;; however, it no longer qualifies. . Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel, wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron. A modest amount of wrought iron was used as a raw material for manufacturing of steel, which was mainly to produce swords, cutlery, chisels, axes and other edge tools as well as springs and files. Demand for wrought iron reached its peak in the 1860s with the adaptation of ironclad warships and railways, but then declined as mild steel became more available. Before they came to be made of mild steel, items produced from wrought iron included rivets, nails, wire, chains, railway couplings, water and steam pipes, nuts, bolts, horseshoes, handrails, straps for timber roof trusses, and ornamental ironwork. Wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale. Many products described as wrought iron, such as guard rails, garden furniture and gates, are made of mild steel. They retain that description because they are wrought (worked) by hand. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 7, 2011.)</p>
