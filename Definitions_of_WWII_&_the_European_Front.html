The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region (also known as the Memel Territory), which had been detached from Germany after World War I, or the Wehrmacht would invade Lithuania. After years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany, increasing pro-Nazi propaganda in the region, and continued German expansion, the demand was expected. The ultimatum was issued just five days after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. The four signatories of the 1924 Klaipėda Convention, which had guaranteed the protection of the status quo in the region, did not offer any material assistance. The United Kingdom and France followed a policy of appeasement, while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany. Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on March 22. For Germany it was the last territorial acquisition before World War II; for Lithuania it was a major downturn in economy and morale; for Europe it was further escalation in pre-war tensions. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

There were post-war boundary disputes in Europe and elsewhere, and questions of national self-determination in Poland and in European colonial territories. The immediate post-war period in Europe was characterized by the Soviet Union annexing or converting into Soviet Socialist Republics all the countries that the Red Army had taken over behind its own lines in driving the German invaders out of central and eastern Europe. Countries converted into Soviet Satellite states within the Eastern Bloc were: Poland; Bulgaria; Hungary; Czechoslovakia; Romania; Albania; The German Democratic Republic or communist East Germany was created from the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany, while the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia emerged as an independent communist state not aligned with the USSR. Japan was occupied by the Allies. In accordance with the Potsdam Conference agreements, which promised territorial concessions to the USSR in the Far East in return for entering the war against Japan, the USSR occupied and subsequently annexed the strategic island of Sakhalin. During the occupation of Japan, the focus would be on demilitarization of the nation, demolition of the Japanese arms industry, and the installation of a democratic government with a new constitution. The Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council For Japan were established to administer the occupation of Japan. These bodies served a similar function to the Allied Control Council in occupied Germany. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

There had been several years of pressure by supporters from both countries Austria and Germany for the &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;-movement, from both Nazis and non-Nazis. Earlier, Nazi Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership. Devoted to remaining independent but under considerable pressure from both German and Austrian Nazis, Austria's Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg tried to hold a referendum for a vote on the issue. Although Schuschnigg expected Austria to vote in favor of maintaining autonomy, a well-planned coup d'état by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on 11 March, prior to the referendum, which they cancelled. They transferred power to Germany, and Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month – asking the people to ratify the fait accompli. They claimed to have received 99.73% of the vote in favor. Although the Allies were committed to upholding the terms of the treaties of Versailles and St. Germain, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany, their reaction was only verbal and moderate. No fighting ever took place and even the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (the &quot;Stresa Front&quot;) remained at peace. The Anschluss was among the first major steps in Adolf Hitler's creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories which Germany had lost afterWorld War I, although Austria had never been a part of the (in 20th-century terms) German state. Prior to the 1938 annexation, Germany had remilitarized the Rhineland, and the Saar region was returned to Germany after 15 years of occupation through a plebiscite. After the Anschluss, Germany targeted Czechoslovakia, provoking an international crisis which led to the Munich Agreement in September 1938, giving the Third Reich control of the industrial Sudetenland, which had a predominantly ethnic German population. In March 1939, Hitler then invaded truncated Czechoslovakia and made the rest of the nation a protectorate. That same year, Memelland was returned from Lithuania. Austria ceased to exist as a fully-independent nation until late 1945. A Provisional Austrian Government was set up on 27 April 1945, and was legally recognized by the Allies in the following months. It was not until 1955 that Austria regained full sovereignty. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The term is most often applied to the foreign policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany between 1937 and 1939. His policies of avoiding war with Germany have been the subject of intense debate for seventy years among academics, politicians and diplomats. The historian's assessment of Chamberlain has ranged from condemnation for allowing Hitler to grow too strong, to the judgement that he had no alternative and acted in Britain's best interests. At the time, these concessions were widely seen as positive, and the Munich Pact among Germany, Great Britain, France and Italy prompted Chamberlain to announce that he had secured &quot;peace for our time&quot;. The word &quot;appeasement&quot; has been used as a synonym for weakness and even cowardice since the 1930s, and it is still used in that sense today as a justification for firm, often armed, action in international relations. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It was formed in February 1942 from the <span class="style_1">Związek Walki Zbrojnej</span> (Union for Armed Struggle). Over the next two years, it absorbed most other Polish underground forces. It was loyal to the Polish government in exile and constituted the armed wing of what became known as the &quot;Polish Underground State.&quot; Estimates of its membership in 1944 range from 200,000 to 600,000, with the most common number being 400,000; that figure would make it not only the largest Polish underground resistance movement but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II. It was disbanded on January 20, 1945, when Polish territory had been mostly cleared of German forces by the advancing Soviet Red Army. The AK's primary resistance operations were the sabotage of German activities, including transports headed for the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union. The AK also fought several full-scale battles against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and 1944 during Operation Tempest. They tied down significant German forces, diverting much-needed supplies, while trying to support the Soviet military. The most widely known AK operation was the failed Warsaw Uprising. The AK also defended Polish civilians against atrocities committed by non-German military organizations, such as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Lithuanian Security Police. Due to its ties with the Polish government in exile, the <span class="style_1">Armia Krajowa</span> was viewed by the Soviet Union as a major obstacle to its takeover of the country. There was increasing conflict between AK and Soviet forces both during and after the war. Considered a model of heroic resistance in modern Poland, <span class="style_1">Armia Krajowa</span> has occasionally been the subject of controversy. It was portrayed more critically in the Soviet Union (which saw the Underground State as an enemy) and some post-Soviet states (primarily Lithuania and Ukraine, where military groups who cooperated with Germans against the Soviets and/or were trying to separate from Polish control also clashed with the Polish resistance).(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

It was drafted by the Britain and the United States, and later agreed to by all the Allies. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war: no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; free access to raw materials; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. In the &quot;Declaration by United Nations&quot; of 1 January 1942, the Allies of World War II pledged adherence to the charter's principles. The Charter set goals rather than a blueprint for the postwar world. It inspired many of the international agreements that shaped the world. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the post-war independence of European colonies, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

A British naval task force attacked the main part of the French fleet, which was at anchor there, resulting in the deaths of 1,297 French servicemen, the sinking of a battleship and the damaging of five other ships. France and Britain were not at war but France had signed an armistice with Germany and Britain feared the French fleet would end up as a part of the German Navy. Although French Admiral François Darlan had assured Winston Churchill the fleet would not fall into German possession, the British acted upon the assumption that Darlan's promises were insufficient guarantees. The attack remains controversial to this day, and created much rancor between Britain and France, but it also demonstrated to the world and to the United States in particular, Britain's commitment to continue the war with Germany.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

It began in 1936 with treaties of friendship between Germany and Italy and between Germany and Japan. The &quot;Rome-Berlin Axis&quot; became a full military alliance in 1939 under the Pact of Steel, and the Tripartite Pact of 1940 fully integrated the military aims of Germany, Italy, and Japan. At their zenith in the midst of World War II, the Axis powers ruled empires that dominated large parts of Europe, Africa, East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean, but that war ended with their total defeat and dissolution. Like the Allies, membership of the Axis was fluid, and other nations entered and later left the Axis during the course of the war.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

At its core was the Allied naval blockade of Germany, announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the <span class="style_1">Kriegsmarine</span> (German Navy) and aircraft of the <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> (German Air Force) against Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from North America and mainly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from September 13, 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the Italian Royal Navy (<span class="style_1">Regia Marina</span>) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on June 10, 1940. As an island nation, the United Kingdom was highly dependent on imported goods. Britain required more than a million tons of imported material per week in order to be able to survive and fight. In essence, the Battle of the Atlantic was a tonnage war: the Allied struggle to supply Britain and the Axis attempt to stem the flow of merchant shipping which enabled Britain to keep fighting. From 1942 onwards, the Germans also sought to prevent the build-up of Allied supplies and equipment in the British Isles in preparation for the invasion of occupied Europe. The defeat of the U-boat threat was a pre-requisite for pushing back the Germans. Winston Churchill was later to state: &quot;The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome.&quot; The outcome of the battle was a strategic victory for the Allies—the German blockade failed—but at great cost: 3,500 merchant ships and 175 warships were sunk for the loss of 783 U-boats. The name &quot;Battle of the Atlantic&quot;, coined by Winston Churchill in 1941, covers a campaign that began on the first day of the European war and lasted for six years, involved thousands of ships and stretched over thousands of square miles of ocean in more than 100 convoy battles and perhaps 1,000 single-ship encounters. The situation swung back and forth over the six years as new weapons, tactics and counter-measures were developed by both sides. The Allies gradually gained the upper hand, driving the German surface raiders from the ocean by the end of 1942 and decisively defeating the U-boats by mid-1943. New German submarine types arrived in 1945, too late to affect the course of the war.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The Battle in Berlin lasted from 20 April 1945 until the morning of 2 May. The first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were on 20 March, when the newly appointed commander of the Army Group Vistula, General Gotthard Heinrici, correctly anticipated that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the Oder River. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Soviets managed to encircle the city as a result of the battles of the Seelow Heights and Halbe. During 20 April 1945, the 1st Belorussian Front led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov started shelling Berlin's city centre, while Marshal Ivan Konev's 1st Ukrainian Front had pushed in the north through the last formations of Army Group Centre. The German defenses were mainly led by Helmuth Weidling and consisted of several depleted, badly equipped, and disorganized <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span> and Waffen-SS divisions, as well as many <span class="style_1">Volkssturm</span> and Hitler Youth members. Within the next days, the Soviets were rapidly advancing through the city and were reaching the city centre, conquering the <span class="style_1">Reichstag</span> on 30 April after fierce fighting. Before the battle was over, German Führer Adolf Hitler and a number of his followers committed suicide. The city's defenders finally surrendered on 2 May. However, fighting continued to the north-west, west and south-west of the city until the end of the war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The objective of the campaign was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command. The name derives from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: &quot;...the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin.&quot; The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces, and was also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date. From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centers, such as Portsmouth, were the main targets; one month later the <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure. As the battle progressed the <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure. Eventually the <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> resorted to attacking areas of political significance and using terror bombing tactics. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defenses, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war. If Germany had gained air superiority over England, Adolf Hitler might have launched Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span>'s code name for the offensive was Unternehmen <span class="style_1">Wacht am Rhein</span> (&quot;Operation <span class="style_1">Watch on the Rhine</span>&quot;), after the German patriotic hymn <span class="style_1">Die Wacht am Rhein</span>. This German offensive was officially named the Ardennes-Alsace campaign by the U.S. Army, but it is known to the English-speaking general public simply as the Battle of the Bulge, the &quot;bulge&quot; being the initial incursion the Germans put into the Allies' line of advance, as seen in maps presented in contemporary newspapers. The German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as <span class="style_1">Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif,</span> and <span class="style_1">Währung</span>. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp, Belgium, and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers' favor. Once accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theatre of war. The offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. Although Ultra suggested a possible attack and the Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, the Allies were still caught by surprise. This was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with their own offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. Near-complete surprise against a weakly defended section of the Allied line was achieved during heavy overcast weather, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance, particularly around the key town of Bastogne, and terrain favoring the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule. Allied reinforcements, including General George Patton's Third Army, and improving weather conditions, which permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line. For the Americans, with about 840,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including 19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest battle that they fought in World War II.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when Nazi Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete under the code-name <span class="style_1">Unternehmen Merkur</span> (&quot;Operation Mercury&quot;). Greek and Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, defended the island. After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered very heavy casualties and none of their objectives had been achieved. The next day, through miscommunication and the failure of Allied commanders to grasp the situation, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans, enabling them to fly in reinforcements and overwhelm the defenders. The battle lasted about 10 days. The Battle of Crete was unprecedented in three respects: it was not only the first battle where the <span class="style_1">Fallschirmjäger</span> (&quot;parachute rangers&quot;) were used on a massive scale, but also the first mainly airborne invasion in military history; the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the deciphered German Enigma code; and the first time invading German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. Because of the heavy casualties suffered by the paratroopers, Adolf Hitler forbade further large scale airborne operations. However, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to build their own airborne divisions.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The battle consisted of two main operations. In the first, <span class="style_1">Fall Gelb</span> (Case Yellow), German armored units pushed through the Ardennes, to cut off and surround the Allied units that had advanced into Belgium. During the fighting, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and many French soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo. In the second operation, <span class="style_1">Fall Rot</span> (Case Red), executed from 5 June, German forces outflanked the Maginot Line and pushed deep into France. Italy declared war on France on 10 June and soon afterwards the French government fled to the city of Bordeaux. France's capital of Paris was occupied on 14 June. On 17 June, Philippe Pétain publicly announced France would ask for an armistice. On 22 June, an armistice was signed between France and Germany, going into effect on 25 June. For the Axis Powers, the campaign was a spectacular victory. Following the Battle of Britain, France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west, a small Italian occupation zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone—the <span class="style_1">zone libre</span>—in the south. A rump state—Vichy France—administered all three zones according to the terms laid out in the armistice. In November 1942, the Axis forces also occupied the <span class="style_1">zone libre</span>, and metropolitan France remained under Axis occupation until after the Allied landings in 1944. The Low Countries remained under German occupation until 1944 and 1945.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

Greece was supported by British Commonwealth forces, while the Germans' Axis allies Italy and Bulgaria played secondary roles. The Battle of Greece is usually distinguished from the Greco-Italian War fought in northwestern Greece and southern Albania from October 1940, as well as from the Battle of Crete fought in late May. These operations, along with the Invasion of Yugoslavia, comprise the Balkans Campaign of World War II.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

It is considered the largest encirclement of troops in history. The operation ran from 23 August-26 September 1941 as part of Operation Barbarossa. In Soviet military history it is referred to as the Kiev Defensive Operation (Киевская оборонительная операция), with somewhat different dating of 7 July-26 September 1941. Nearly the entire Southwestern Front of the Red Army was encircled with the Germans claiming 665,000 captured. However, the Kiev encirclement was not complete, and small groups of Red Army troops managed to escape the cauldron days after the German pincers met east of the city, including head quarters of Marshall Semyon Budyonny, Marshall Semen Timoshenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev. The commander of the Southwestern Front—Mikhail Kirponos—was trapped behind enemy lines and killed while trying to break through. The Kiev disaster was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, exceeding even the Minsk tragedy of June–July 1941. On 1 September, the Southwestern Front numbered 752-760,000 troops (850,000 including reserves and rear service organs), 3,923 guns &amp; mortars, 114 tanks and 167 combat aircraft. The encirclement trapped 452,700 troops, 2,642 guns &amp; mortars and 64 tanks, of which scarcely 15,000 escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. Overall, the Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured, or missing during the month-long Battle for Kiev. As a result, four Soviet field armies (5th, 37th, 26th, and 21st) consisting of 43 divisions virtually ceased to exist. The 40th Army was badly affected as well. Like the Western Front before it, the Southwestern Front had to be recreated almost from scratch.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

It remains both the largest series of armored clashes, including the Battle of Prokhorovka, and the costliest single day of aerial warfare in history. It was the final strategic offensive the Germans were able to mount in the east.

It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler's attack on Moscow, capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the largest Soviet city. Moscow was one of the primary military and political objectives for Axis forces in their invasion of the Soviet Union. The German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to conduct two pincer offensives, one to the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front by the 3rd and 4th <span class="style_1">Panzer</span> Groups, simultaneously severing the Moscow-Leningrad railway, and another to the south of Moscow Oblast against the Western Front, south of Tula by the 2nd <span class="style_1">Panzer</span> Army, while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west. A separate operational German plan, codenamed <span class="style_1">Operation Wotan</span>, was included in the final phase of the German offensive. Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a strategic defense of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three defensive belts, and deploying newly raised reserve armies as well as bringing troops from the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts. Subsequently, as the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations were executed to force German armies back to the positions around the cities of Oryol, Vyazma and Vitebsk, nearly surrounding three German armies in the process. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until 14 May 1940 when the main Dutch forces surrendered. However, Dutch troops in the province of Zealand continued to resist the <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span> until 17 May when Germany completed its occupation of the whole nation. The Battle of the Netherlands saw one of the first major uses of paratroopers to occupy crucial targets prior to ground troops reaching the area. The German <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> utilized paratroopers in the capture of several major airfields in the Netherlands in and around key cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague in order to quickly overrun the nation and immobilize Dutch forces. The battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the German Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat by the Germans to bomb other large Dutch cities if Dutch forces refused to surrender. The Dutch General Staff knew it could not stop the bombers and surrendered in order to prevent other cities from suffering the same fate. The Netherlands remained under German occupation until 1945, when the last Dutch territory was liberated. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The Soviet formations were the Western Front commanded by Timoshenko, the Soviet Reserve Front commanded by Zhukov, the Soviet Central Front commanded by Kuznetsov, and Soviet Bryansk Front commanded by Yeremenko. Ultimately, the Soviet 16th, 19th and the 20th Armies were encircled just to the south of Smolensk but large parts of the 19th Army managed to escape the pocket. As a result of large parts of Soviet soldiers escaping the net, Hitler called off the operation for encirclement as the premier means of defeating the Soviet Union and concentrated on inflicting severe economic damage to the Soviet Union.(wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The battle took place between 23 August 1942 and 2 February 1943. It was among the largest on the Eastern Front and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties. It was amongst the bloodiest battles in the history of warfare with the higher estimates of combined casualties amounting to nearly two million. In its defeat, the crippling losses suffered by Germany's military proved to be insurmountable for the war. The battle was a turning point in the war, after which the German forces attained no further strategic victories in the East. The German offensive to capture Stalingrad commenced in late summer 1942, supported by intensive <span class="style_1">Luftwaffe</span> bombing which reduced much of the city to rubble. The German offensive eventually became bogged down in house-to-house fighting; and despite controlling over 90% of the city at times, the <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span> was unable to dislodge the last Soviet defenders clinging tenaciously to the west bank of the Volga River. In November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus; a two-pronged attack, targeted at the inferior Romanian and Italian forces which were protecting the German 6th Army flanks. The success of these attacks caused the weakly held flanks to collapse and the 6th Army to be cut off and surrounded inside Stalingrad. As the Russian winter set in, the 6th Army weakened rapidly from cold, starvation and ongoing Soviet attacks. Command ambiguity coupled with Adolf Hitler's resolute belief in the &quot;power of the will&quot; and the value of &quot;standing fast&quot; further compounded the German predicament. Eventually, the failure to break the encirclement by relieving German forces, coupled with the failure of re-supply by air, caused the final collapse. By early February 1943, German resistance in Stalingrad had ceased and the remaining elements of the surrounded 6th Army had either surrendered or had been destroyed. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The two forces launched separate but loosely coordinated operations that were sufficient to evict the Germans from the Belgrade area. The offensive involved the 1st Army Group of the Yugoslav Partisans to the west, the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front (including the Bulgarian 2nd Army), and elements of the 2nd Ukrainian Front to the north conducting an offensive against part of Germany's Army Group E (<span class="style_1">Korpsgruppe</span> &quot;Schneckenburger&quot; and &quot;Stern&quot;) which included the forces of the Serbian fifth column, the Chetniks and the Serbian State Guard. The objective was to destroy the forces of the German Army Group E in the Suva Planina region, and those of Army Group F east of Velika Morava river, and ultimately to take Belgrade. A secondary objective for the offensive was to sever the line of retreat for German Army Group E from Greece, Albania and the southern regions of Yugoslavia through Belgrade to Hungary, including the Salonica-Belgrade railroad. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, or MVSN). The term was later applied to a similar group serving the British Union of Fascists before World War II, to the SS in Nazi Germany, and to members of a quasi-political organization in India. Inspired by the military prowess and black uniforms of the Arditi, Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by Benito Mussolini as the military tool of his political movement. The founders of the paramilitary groups were nationalist intellectuals, former army officers and young landowners opposing peasants' and country laborers' unions. Their methods became harsher as Mussolini's power grew, and they used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Through constant motion, the blitzkrieg attempts to keep its enemy off-balance, making it difficult to respond effectively at any given point before the front has already moved on. During the interwar period, aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the German tactics of infiltration and bypassing of enemy strong points. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Western journalists adopted the term blitzkrieg to describe this form of armored warfare. Blitzkrieg operations were very effective during the campaigns of 1939–1941. These operations were dependent on surprise penetrations (e.g. the penetration of the Ardennes forest region), general enemy unpreparedness and an inability to react swiftly enough to the attacker's offensive operations. During the Battle of France, the French, who made attempts to re-form defensive lines along rivers, were constantly frustrated when German forces arrived there first and pressed on. Only later, during the invasion of the Soviet Union, would the flaws of blitzkrieg come to be realized. In France and Poland the foot-bound infantry had been, at most, a few hours behind the armored spearheads. In the vast open Soviet steppe delays of hours would become days, allowing the Soviet forces to gather at points far behind the lines and thereby give their infantry enough time to set up defensive positions. In the Battle of Stalingrad for instance, the Soviet forces formed up hundreds of kilometers from the German breakout point. The Germans as well as the Allies, both in the West and the Soviet Union, would eventually realize the failings of blitzkrieg warfare. Academics since the 1970s have questioned the existence of blitzkrieg as a coherent military doctrine or strategy. Many academic historians hold blitzkrieg itself to be a myth. Others continue to use the word to describe German strategy and doctrine throughout the Second World War. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The raid by planes of the German Luftwaffe &quot;Condor Legion&quot; and the Italian Fascist Aviazione Legionaria was called Operation Rügen. The Basque government reported 1,654 people killed, but modern speculations suggests between 200 to 400 civilians died. Russian archives reveal 800 deaths on May 1, 1937, but this number may not include victims who later died of their injuries in hospitals or whose bodies were discovered buried in the rubble. The bombing has often been considered one of the first raids in the history of modern military aviation on a defenseless civilian population, and denounced as a terrorist act, although the capital (Madrid) had been bombed many times previously. The bombing was the subject of a famous anti-war painting by Pablo Picasso. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 21, 2011.)</p>

The meeting was attended by President Franklin Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. Soviet leader Stalin refused to attend the conference on the grounds that since Chiang was attending, it would cause provocation between the Soviet Union and Japan. (The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941 was a five-year agreement of neutrality between the two nations; in 1943 the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan, whereas China, the U.K. and the U.S. were.) The Cairo meeting was held at a residence of the American Ambassador to Egypt, Alexander Kirk, near the Pyramids. Stalin did meet two days later with Roosevelt and Churchill in Tehran, Iran for the Tehran Conference. The Cairo Declaration was signed on 27 November 1943 and released in a <span class="style_1">Cairo Communiqué</span> through radio on 1 December 1943, stating the Allies' intentions to continue deploying military force until Japan's unconditional surrender. The three main clauses of the Cairo Declaration are that &quot;Japan be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914&quot;, &quot;all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China&quot;, and that &quot;in due course Korea shall become free and independent&quot;.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

Following a final conversation with French Premier Pierre Laval, Hitler gave orders for Corsica to be occupied on 11 November, and Vichy France the following day. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

For this part of the operation, Army Group South (<span class="style_1">Heeresgruppe Süd</span>) of the German Army (<span class="style_1">Wehrmacht Heer</span>) was sub-divided into Army Groups A and B (<span class="style_1">Heeresgruppe A</span> and <span class="style_1">B</span>). Army Group A was tasked with crossing the Caucasus mountains to reach the Baku oil fields, while Army Group B protected its flanks along the Volga. Initially, the German offensive saw spectacular gains with a rapid advance into the Caucasus capturing vast areas of land and several oil fields. However, the Red Army defeated the Germans at Stalingrad following operations Uranus and Little Saturn. This defeat forced the Axis to retreat from the Caucasus for fear of becoming trapped. Only the city of Voronezh and the Kuban region remained tentatively occupied by Axis troops. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

It replaced the Neutrality Acts of 1936. The revision allowed the sale of materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arranged for the transport using their own ships and paid immediately in cash, assuming all risk in transportation. The purpose was to hold neutrality between the United States and European countries while still giving aid to Britain, exploiting the fact that Germany had no funds and could not reliably ship across the British-controlled Atlantic. Various policies forbade selling implements of war or lending money to belligerent countries under any terms. The U.S. economy was rebounding at this time, following the Great Depression, but there was still a need for industrial manufacturing jobs. The cash and carry program helped to solve this issue and in turn Great Britain benefited from the purchase of arms and other goods. This program also prevented U.S. businesses interests backing the success or failure of any warring nation. Because of the conclusion of the Nye Committee, which asserted that United States involvement in World War I was driven by private interests from arms manufacturers, many Americans believed that investment in a belligerent would eventually lead to American participation in war. U.S. shipping interests were forbidden from entering into conflict zones. This act also made sure that the U.S. did not give away all its supplies and rations.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

World War II started after these aggressive actions were met with an official declaration of war and/or armed resistance.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

Although the chief military forces never engaged in a major battle with each other, they expressed the conflict through military coalitions, strategic conventional force deployments, extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable, proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, conventional and nuclear arms races, appeals to neutral nations, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The principle of &quot;complete victory&quot; established an early precedent for the Allied policy of obtaining the Axis' powers' &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;. The defeat of &quot;Hitlerism&quot; constituted the overarching objective, and represented a common Allied perspective that the totalitarian militarist regimes ruling Germany, Italy, and Japan were indistinguishable. The declaration, furthermore, &quot;upheld the Wilsonian principles of self determination,&quot; thus linking U.S. war aims in both world wars. By the end of the war, a number of other states had acceded to the declaration, including the Philippines, France, every Latin American state except Argentina, and the various independent states of the Middle East and Africa. Although most of the minor Axis powers had switched sides and joined the United Nations as co-belligerents against Germany by the end of the war, they were not allowed to accede to the declaration.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

In his (&quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;) speech, he hailed their rescue as a &quot;miracle of deliverance&quot;. On the first day, only 7,011 men were evacuated, but by the ninth day, a total of 338,226 soldiers (198,229 British and 139,997 French) had been rescued by the hastily assembled fleet of 850 boats. Many of the troops were able to embark from the harbor's protective mole onto 42 British destroyers and other large ships, while others had to wade from the beaches toward the ships, waiting for hours to board, shoulder-deep in water. Others were ferried from the beaches to the larger ships, and thousands were carried back to Britain by the famous &quot;little ships of Dunkirk&quot;, a flotilla of around 700 merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats—the smallest of which was the 15 ft (4.6 m) fishing boat <span class="style_1">Tamzine</span>, now in the Imperial War Museum—whose civilian crews were called into service for the emergency. The &quot;miracle of the little ships&quot; remains a prominent folk memory in Britain. Operation Dynamo took its name from the dynamo room in the naval headquarters below Dover Castle, which contained the dynamo that provided the building with electricity during the war. It was in this room that British Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay planned the operation and briefed Winston Churchill as it was under way. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The first contact was made between patrols near Strehla, when First Lieutenant Albert Kotzebue crossed the River Elbe in a boat with three men of an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon. On the east bank, they met forward elements of a Soviet Guards-rifle-regiment of the First Ukrainian Front under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gardiev. On April 26, the commanders of the 69th Infantry Division of the First Army and the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army (Soviet Union) met at Torgau, southwest of Berlin. Arrangements were made for the formal <span class="style_1">&quot;Handshake of Torgau&quot;</span> between Robertson and Silvashko in front of photographers the following day <span class="style_1">(pictured)</span>. Statements were released simultaneously in London, Moscow, and Washington that evening, reaffirming the determination of the three Allied powers to complete the destruction of the Third Reich. Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker four days later.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

It is used in referring to the repeated confrontations that occurred during the first-half of the 20th century. There is no firm consensus over the details and links, such as the Spanish Civil War and, occasionally, the Russian Civil War and Russian Revolution. The term is often used to explain the rapid decline of Europe's global hegemony and the emergence of the European Union. By this self-mutilation, Europe lost its position in the world, its hegemony, and caused itself to be divided into two spheres of influence: one &quot;Western&quot;, and one Soviet.. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The Soviet 38th Army was ordered to defend the city while its factories were dismantled for relocation farther east. By 21 October, all of the factory equipment had been loaded on to rail trains. On this day the Germans closed to within 11 km of the railway yards. The German 6th Army executed a northern envelopment of the city while the 17th Army did the same from the south of the Soviet defensive positions on 24 October. Although the city was taken by German troops on the same day, most of the rail transport was evacuated by the Soviet authorities.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The later stages of World War II, and the period after the end of that war, saw the forced migration of millions of German nationals (Reichsdeutsche) and ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) from various European states and territories, mostly into the areas which would become post-war Germany and post-war Austria. These areas included pre-war German provinces which were transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union after the war, as well as areas which Nazi Germany had annexed or occupied in pre-war Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, northern Yugoslavia and other states of Central and Eastern Europe. The movement of Germans involved a total of at least 12 million people, with some sources putting the figure at 14 million, and was the largest movement or transfer of any population in modern history, with the possible exception of the Partition of India in 1947. The largest numbers came from the former eastern territories of Germany acquired by Poland and the Soviet Union (about 7 million) and from Czechoslovakia (about 3 million). It was also the largest among all the post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe, which displaced more than twenty million people in total. The events have been variously described as population transfer, ethnic cleansing or democide. Many deaths were attributable to the flight and expulsions, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 2 million, where modern estimates are close to the lower 500,000 figure. Many German civilians were also sent to internment and labor camps. The policy was part of the geopolitical and ethnic reconfiguration of postwar Europe; in part spoils of war, in part political changes in Europe following the war and in part recompense for atrocities and ethnic cleansings that had occurred during the war. The displacements occurred in three somewhat overlapping phases, the first of which was the spontaneous flight and evacuation of Germans in the face of the advancing Red Army from mid-1944 to 1945, the second a disorganized expulsion of Germans immediately following the German defeat, and the third a more organized expulsion following the Potsdam Agreement, which redrew national borders and approved &quot;orderly&quot; and &quot;humane&quot; expulsions of Germans from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The major expulsions were complete by 1950, when the total number of ethnic Germans still living in Eastern Europe was approximately 2.6 million, about 12% of the pre-war total.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

Résistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the Maquis in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines. The men and women of the Résistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of the French society, including émigrés; from conservative Roman Catholics (including priests), from the Jewish community, and from the ranks of liberals, anarchists, and communists. The French Résistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August, by providing military intelligence on the German defenses known as the <span class="style_1">Atlantic Wall</span> and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle. The Résistance also planned, coordinated, and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid, transportation facilities, and telecommunications networks. It was also politically and morally important to France, both during the German occupation and for decades afterward, because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French <span class="style_1">nationhood</span>. The actions of the Résistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the regime installed at Vichy.<span class="style_2"> </span>After the landings in Normandy and Provence, the paramilitary components of the Résistance were organized more formally, into a hierarchy of operational units known, collectively, as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944, the FFI grew rapidly, doubling by the following month, and reaching approximately 400,000 by October of that year. Although the amalgamation of the FFI was, in some cases, fraught with political difficulties, it was ultimately successful, and it allowed France to rebuild a reasonably large army (1.2 million men) by VE Day in May 1945. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

It remained in existence from May 1940 to December 1944. As a result of the defeat of France and its Allies in the Battle of France, the French cabinet sought a cessation of hostilities. An armistice was signed on 22 June 1940 at Compiègne. Under its terms, a designated area in the north and west of France, the <span class="style_1">zone occupée</span>, was occupied by the German Army; in this region, the French government located at Vichy, headed by the aging Maréchal Philippe Pétain, was subordinate to the Germans. Most of the remaining third of the country was set aside as the <span class="style_1">zone libre</span>, to be fully controlled by the Vichy government. Alsace and Lorraine were reincorporated into Germany proper (thus subjecting their male population to German military conscription.) Several departments along the Italian border were occupied by Italian troops, while areas along the Belgian frontier were administered by the German occupation authorities in Brussels. The entire Atlantic coastline was declared a military zone, placing it off-limits to French civilians (except for local inhabitants, who required a special pass). Both the unoccupied and the occupied portions of France remained legally under the control of the Vichy government. When the Allies invaded North Africa on 8 November 1942, the Germans and Italians immediately occupied the remaining free part of France. The liberation of France began on 6 June 1944 with the Allied forces landing on D-Day and the Battle of Normandy and ended in December. Paris itself was liberated on 25 August 1944.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's pretext for this effort was the alleged privations suffered by ethnic German populations living in those regions. There also existed new and extensive Czechoslovak border fortifications in the same area. Following the Anschluss of Nazi Germany and Austria, in March 1938, the conquest of Czechoslovakia became Hitler's next ambition. The incorporation of Sudetenland into Nazi Germany left the rest of Czechoslovakia weak and it became powerless to resist subsequent occupation. On 16 March 1939, the German Wehrmacht moved into the remainder of Czechoslovakia and, from Prague Castle, Hitler proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The occupation ended with the surrender of Germany following World War II. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The agreement continued the countries' relationship that started in 1939 with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact containing secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany, and the subsequent invasions by Germany and the Soviet Union of that territory. The <span class="style_1">German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement</span> contained additional secret protocols settling a dispute regarding land in Lithuania previously split between the countries. The agreement continued Nazi-Soviet economic relations that had been expanded by the 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement and the larger 1940 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement. The agreement proved to be short lived. Just six months after it was signed, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and economic relations between the two countries came to an end. The raw materials imported by Germany from the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1941 played a major role in supporting the German war effort against the Soviet Union after 1941. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

It was a follow up to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, dated August 23. Only a small portion of the treaty was publicly announced. . . Several secret articles were attached. These articles allowed the exchange of Russian and German nationals from the other sides partition of Poland, redrew parts of the central European spheres of interest dictated by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and included an agreement to suppress any &quot;Polish agitation&quot;. When <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span> advanced against Poland, Germans took control of the Lublin Voivodeship and eastern Warsaw Voivodeship, territories which according to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were in the Soviet sphere of influence. To compensate the Soviet Union for this loss, the treaty's secret attachment transferred Lithuania, except for a small territory in the Suwałki Region sometimes known as the Suwałki Triangle, to the Soviet sphere of influence. After this transfer, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Lithuania, occupied it on June 15, 1940 and established the Lithuanian SSR. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

So, to downgrade its importance in the eyes of both friend and foe, he ordered the name, with its historic connotations, changed, reasoning that if the Allies managed to break through they would not be able to use the more impressive name to magnify their victory claims. In response to this order, Kesselring renamed it the &quot;Green Line&quot; (<span class="style_1">Grüne Linie</span>) in June 1944. The Gothic Line was breached on both the Adriatic and the central Apennine fronts during Operation Olive (also sometimes known as the Battle of Rimini) during the autumn of 1944, but Kesselring's forces were consistently able to retire in good order, and no decisive breakthrough was achieved. This did not take place until the renewed offensive in the spring of 1945. Operation Olive has been described as the biggest battle of materials ever fought in Italy. Over 1,200,000 men participated in the battle. The battle took the form of a pincer maneuver, carried out by the British 8th Army and U.S. 5th Army against the German 10th Army (10. <span class="style_1">Armee</span>) and German 14th Army (14. <span class="style_1">Armee</span>). Rimini, a city which had been hit previously by air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

A superpower is traditionally considered to be a step higher than a great power. Alice Lyman Miller (Professor of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School), defines a superpower as &quot;a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony.&quot; It was a term first applied in 1944 to the British Empire, the Soviet Union and the United States of America. Following World War II, as the British Empire transformed itself into the Commonwealth and its territories became independent, the Soviet Union and the United States generally came to be regarded as the only two superpowers, and confronted each other in the Cold War.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 25, 2011.)</p>

Roosevelt and Winston Churchill between November 28 and December 1, 1943, most of which was held at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, Iran. It was the first World War II conference amongst the Big Three (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom) in which Stalin was present. It almost immediately followed the Cairo Conference (November 22–26, 1943) and preceded both the Yalta Conference (February 4–11, 1945) and the Potsdam Conference (July 17 - August 2, 1945). The central aim of the Tehran conference was to plan the final strategy for the war against Nazi Germany and its allies, and the chief discussion was centered on the opening of a second front in Western Europe. At the same time, the conference discussed relations with Turkey and Iran, operations in Yugoslavia and against Japan, and the post-war settlement. A separate protocol pledged the three countries to recognize Iran's independence. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 24, 2011.)</p>

In the mid-19th Century, &quot;total war&quot; was identified by scholars as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, there is less differentiation between combatants and civilians than in other conflicts, and sometimes no such differentiation at all, as nearly every human resource, civilians and soldiers alike, can be considered to be part of the belligerent effort.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 24, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice signed on November 11, 1918 ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on October 21, 1919, and was printed in The League of Nations Treaty Series. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required Germany to accept responsibility for causing the war (along with Austria and Hungary, according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Trianon) and, under the terms of articles 231–248 (later known as the War Guilt clauses), to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and pay heavy reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. The total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion Marks (then $31.4 billion, £6.6 billion) in 1921 which is roughly equivalent to US $442 billion and UK £217 billion in 2011, a sum that many economists at the time, notably John Maynard Keynes, deemed to be excessive and counterproductive and would have taken Germany until 1988 to pay. The final payments ended up being made on October 4, 2010, the 20th anniversary of German reunification, and some 92 years after the end of the war for which they were exacted. The Treaty was undermined by subsequent events starting as early as 1932 and was widely flouted by the mid-1930s. The result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was compromise that left none contented: Germany was not pacified or conciliated, nor permanently weakened. This would prove to be a factor leading to later conflicts, notably and directly World War II.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 12-14, 2011.)</p>

The Declaration arose directly from the experience of the Second World War and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled. It consists of 30 articles which have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions and laws. The International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols. In 1966 the General Assembly adopted the two detailed Covenants, which complete the International Bill of Human Rights; and in 1976, after the Covenants had been ratified by a sufficient number of individual nations, the Bill took on the force of international law. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 12-14, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">Vichy France, Vichy Regime, or Vichy Government, are common terms used to describe the government of France that collaborated with the Axis powers from July 1940 to August 1944. This government succeeded the Third Republic and preceded the Provisional Government of the French Republic. It officially called itself the French State, in contrast with the previous designation, the French Republic. Marshal Philippe Pétain proclaimed the government following the military defeat of France by Germany during World War II and the vote by the National Assembly on 10 July 1940. This vote granted extraordinary powers to Pétain, the last <span class="style_1">Président du Conseil</span> (Prime Minister) of the Third Republic, who then took the additional title <span class="style_1">Chef de l'État Français</span> (&quot;Chief of the French State&quot;). Pétain headed the reactionary program of the so-called &quot;<span class="style_1">Révolution nationale</span>&quot;, aimed at &quot;regenerating the nation.&quot; The Vichy regime maintained some legal authority in the northern zone of France (the <span class="style_1">Zone occupée</span>), which was occupied by the German <span class="style_1">Wehrmacht</span>. Its laws, however, were only applied where they did not contradict German ones. This meant that the regime was most powerful in the unoccupied southern &quot;free zone&quot;, where its administrative centre of Vichy was located, until November 1942. After the landing of the Allied forces in North Africa on 8 November 1942, Hitler ordered the occupation of France's free zone, after which the former free zone was subject to German rule like the northern zone, except for a sliver along the Alps that was under Italian rule until September 1943. In the aftermath of the 1940 defeat, Pétain collaborated actively with the German occupying forces. Vichy forces refused to surrender or save the fleet at Mers-el-Kebir for the Allies and fought the Allied invasion of French-controlled Syria and Lebanon in June–July 1941, with just above 15% of the resulting prisoners of war electing to join Free French forces while the others were repatriated to metropolitan France to be demobilized. However, the military ties with Germany weakened over time. The Vichy-mandated scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon stands in contrast to the Mers-el-Kebir episode of two years earlier, and the Vichy French forces put up limited resistance to the Allied invasion of North Africa, with more commanders and units in Africa joining the Free French forces. The Vichy leaders collaborated as far as ordering the French police and the local <span class="style_1">milice</span> (militiamen) to go on raids to capture Jews and other minorities considered &quot;undesirables&quot; by Germany as well as political opponents and members of the Resistance, thus helping enforce German policy in occupied zones. Vichy also promulgated its own, German-inspired laws and policies that restricted political freedom and took rights away from foreigners and racial minorities. The legitimacy of Vichy France and Pétain's leadership was constantly challenged by the exiled General Charles de Gaulle, who claimed to represent the legitimacy and continuity of the French government. Public opinion turned against the Vichy regime and the occupying German forces over time, and resistance to them grew within France. Following the Allies' invasion of France in Operation Overlord, de Gaulle proclaimed the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) in June 1944. After the Liberation of Paris in August, the GPRF installed itself in Paris on 31 August. The GPRF was recognized as the legitimate government of France by the Allies on 23 October 1944. On 20 August 1944, the Vichy officials and chief supporters were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany and there established a government in exile, headed by Fernand de Brinon, until early April 1945. Most of the Vichy regime's leaders were subsequently sentenced by the GPRF and a number of them were executed. Pétain himself was sentenced to death for treason, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 12-14, 2011.)</p>

The formal surrender of the occupying German forces in the Channel Islands was not until 9 May 1945.

There is, however, also the substantially different name Vienna Diktats, expressing the point of view of the countries which stood to lose territory as a result. The awards were overturned following the defeat of Germany in 1945, and Hungary lost again all of the territory it had gained. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Warsaw Uprising was a major World War II operation by the Polish resistance Home Army, to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The rebellion was timed to coincide with the Red Army approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. Controversially, the Soviet advance stopped short, enabling the Germans to regroup and take the city back from the Polish resistance, which fought for 63 days with little outside support. The uprising began on 1 August 1944, as part of a nationwide plan, Operation Tempest, when the Soviet Army approached Warsaw. The main Polish objectives were to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers. Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the Soviets, to underscore Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control. Also, short-term causes included the threat of a German round-up of able-bodied Poles, and Moscow radio calling for the Uprising to begin. Initially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to establish radio contact and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, Polish forces under Soviet high command occupied the east bank of the Vistula River opposite the insurgents' positions; but only 1,200 men made it across to the west bank, and they were not reinforced by the rump of the Red Army. This, and the lack of Soviet air support from a base 5 minutes flying time away, led to allegations that Joseph Stalin tactically halted his forces to make the operation fail. Winston Churchill pleaded with Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help Britain's Polish allies, to no avail. Then, without Soviet air clearance, Churchill sent over 200 low-level supply drops by the Royal Air Force, the South African Air Force and the Polish Air Force under British High Command. Later, after gaining Soviet air clearance, the US Army Air Force sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of Operation Frantic. Although the exact number of casualties remains unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass murders. Atrocities by Russian auxiliaries on the German side included a raid on a ward of Polish female cancer patients, who were raped in their beds, burned alive, then shot as they tried to escape. Jews being harbored by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighborhoods. German casualties totaled over 8,000 soldiers killed and missing, and 9,000 wounded. During the urban combat approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically leveled 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the 1939 invasion of Poland and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945, when the Soviets entered the city. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The campaign was heavily influenced by the availability of supplies and transport. The ability of the Allied forces, operating from besieged Malta to interdict Axis convoys was critical. Allied interdictions denied the German commander, Erwin Rommel, the fuel and the reinforcements he desperately needed at critical moments. In early 1942, the U.S. Army Air Force supplied a small contingent of bombers in support of the campaign, referring to it as the Egypt-Libya Campaign. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The primary Gustav Line ran across Italy from just north of where the Garigliano River flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea in the west, through the Apennine Mountains to the mouth of the Sangro River on the Adriatic coast in the east. The centre of the line, where it crossed the main route north to Rome (Highway 6) which followed the Liri Valley, was anchored around the mountains behind the town of Cassino including Monte Cassino, on which was situated an old abbey that dominated the entrance to the Liri Valley (a main route to Rome), and Monte Cairo which gave the defenders clear observation of potential attackers advancing towards the mouth of the Liri valley. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_2">World War II, or the Second World War (often abbreviated as WWII or WW2), was a global military conflict lasting from 1939 to 1945, which involved most of the world's nations, including all of the great powers: eventually forming two opposing military alliances, the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilized. In a state of &quot;total war,&quot; the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events involving the mass death of civilians, including the Holocaust and the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare, it was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 50 million to over 70 million fatalities. The war is generally accepted to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany, and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and most of the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth. Germany set out to establish a large empire in Europe. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or subdued much of continental Europe; amid Nazi-Soviet agreements, the nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially occupied and annexed territories of its six European neighbors. Britain and the Commonwealth remained the only major force continuing the fight against the Axis in North Africa and in extensive naval warfare. In June 1941, the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the largest land theatre of war in history, which, from that moment on, tied down the major part of the Axis military power. In December 1941, Japan, which had been at war with China since 1937, and aimed to dominate Asia, attacked the United States and European possessions in the Pacific Ocean, quickly conquering much of the region. The Axis advance was stopped in 1942 after the defeat of Japan in a series of naval battles and after defeats of European Axis troops in North Africa and, decisively, at Stalingrad. In 1943, with a series of German defeats in Eastern Europe, the Allied invasion of Fascist Italy, and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France, while the Soviet Union regained all territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. The war in Europe ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. The Japanese Navy was defeated by the United States, and invasion of the Japanese Archipelago (&quot;Home Islands&quot;) became imminent. The war in Asia ended on 15 August 1945 when Japan agreed to surrender. The war ended with the total victory of the Allies over Germany and Japan in 1945. World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the decolonization of Asia and Africa began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to stabilize postwar relations. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and General Secretary Joseph Stalin, respectively, for the purpose of discussing Europe's post-war reorganization. It was intended mainly to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe. The conference convened in the Livadia Palace near Yalta, the Crimea. It was the second of three wartime conferences among the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin). It had been preceded by the Tehran Conference in 1943, and it was followed by the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, which was attended by Harry S. Truman in place of the late Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill, with Churchill replaced mid-point by the newly elected Prime Minister Clement Attlee. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Yugoslav Front started in April 1941 when the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was quickly overrun by Axis forces and partitioned between Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and client regimes in Croatia and Serbia. The war was fought in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II (1941–1945) between the Yugoslav resistance forces and the Axis Powers. During the war two guerrilla resistance armies sprang up: the communist-led and republican Yugoslav Partisans; and the royalist Chetnik movement. In spite of sporadic acts of resistance, after 1941 the Chetniks adopted a &quot;policy of collaboration&quot;, and collaborated extensively and systematically with the Italian occupation forces until the Italian capitulation in September 1943, and beginning in 1944, also with Nazi German and Ustaše forces. A parallel civil war between the two movements soon ensued. The Axis mounted a series of offensives intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in winter and spring of 1943. Despite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, gaining recognition from the Western Allies and laying the foundations for the post-war Yugoslav state. With support in logistics, equipment, training, and air power from the Western Allies, and Soviet ground troops in the Belgrade Offensive, the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and the border regions of Italy and Austria. The human cost of the war was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. The victims included the majority of the country's Jewish population, many of whom perished in concentration camps (e.g. Jasenovac, Banjica) run by the client regimes. In addition, the Croatian Ustaše regime committed genocide against local Serbs and Roma while Chetniks pursued their own ethnic cleansing against the Muslim and Croat population. The Germans (in particular the Dabnube Swabian SS formations) also carried out mass executions of civilians in retaliation for resistance activity, <span class="style_1">e.g.</span> the Kragujevac massacre. Finally, during and after the final stages of the war, the Danube Swabian population in Yugoslavia was deported by the Yugoslav authorities, and Partisan troops summarily executed for treason thousands of fleeing members of the Ustaše, Chetniks, and Croatian Home Guard in what is known as the Bleiburg massacre.

The Partisans were the military arm of the People's Liberation Front (JNOF) coalition, led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) and represented by the AVNOJ, the Yugoslav wartime deliberative assembly. The commander of the Partisans was Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The Partisans' goal was to create an Communist state in Yugoslavia. To this end, the KPJ attempted to appeal to all the various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia, by preserving the rights of each group. The rival resistance movement, the Chetniks, emerged earlier, were united by their desire to ensure the survival of the Serbian population and loyal to the old Royalist regime. Relations between the two movements were uneasy from the start, but from October 1941 they degenerated into full-scale conflict. To the Chetniks, Tito's pan-ethnic policies seemed anti-Serbian, whereas the Chetniks' Royalism was anathema to the Communists. The common name of the movement is &quot;the Partisans&quot; (capitalized), while the adjective &quot;Yugoslav&quot; is used sometimes in exclusively non-Yugoslav sources to distinguish them from other (World War II) partisan movements. Despite the fact that their name suggests they fought as a guerrilla force, this was only true for the first three years of the conflict. From the second half of 1944, the total forces of the Partisans numbered 800,000 men and women organized in four field armies and 52 divisions, which engaged in conventional warfare. When referring to this period, sources often use the term People's Liberation Army.

The invasion was the largest amphibious operation in history. This article covers from the initial landings on 6 June 1944, until the time of the Allied breakout in late July. Allied land forces that saw combat in Normandy on 6 June came from Canada, the Free French Forces, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the weeks following the invasion, Polish forces also participated, as well as contingents from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and the Netherlands. Most of the above countries also provided air and naval support, as did the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. The Normandy invasion began with overnight parachute and glider landings, massive air attacks, naval bombardments, early morning amphibious landings on five beaches codenamed Juno, Gold, Omaha, Utah, and Sword and during the evening the remaining elements of the parachute divisions landed. The &quot;D-Day&quot; forces deployed from bases along the south coast of England, the most important of these being Portsmouth. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and ended on 6 October 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland. The morning after the Gleiwitz incident, German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west. As the Germans advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the Polish-German border to more established lines of defense to the east. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura, the Germans gained an undisputed advantage. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defense of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France and the United Kingdom. The two countries had pacts with Poland and had declared war on Germany on 3 September, though in the end their aid to Poland in the September campaign was very limited. The Soviet Red Army's invasion of Eastern Poland on 17 September, in accordance with a secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, rendered the Polish plan of defense obsolete. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defense of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral Romania. On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered. On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration, Germany directly annexed western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory under the administration of the newly established General Government. The Soviet Union incorporated its newly acquired areas into its constituent Belarusian and Ukrainian republics, and immediately started a campaign of sovietization. This included staged elections, the results of which were used to legitimize the Soviet Union's annexation of eastern Poland. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground resistance organizations formed the Polish Underground State within the territory of the former Polish state. Many of the military exiles that managed to escape Poland subsequently joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West, an armed force loyal to the Polish government in exile. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The Iron Guard was ultra-nationalist, anti-communist who promoted the Orthodox Christian faith. It is also considered an antisemitic organization, an ideologist of which even going as far as to demand an introduction of “state anti-semitism”. Originally founded by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu on July 24, 1927, as the Legion of the Archangel Michael (&quot;Legiunea Arhanghelului Mihail&quot;), and led by him until his death in 1938, adherents to the movement continued to be widely referred to as &quot;legionnaires&quot; (sometimes &quot;legionaries&quot;; Romanian: legionarii) and the organization as the &quot;Legion&quot; or the &quot;Legionary Movement&quot; (&quot;Mişcarea Legionară&quot;), despite various changes of the (intermittently banned) organization's name. In March 1930 Codreanu formed the &quot;Iron Guard&quot; (&quot;Garda de Fier&quot;) as a paramilitary political branch of the Legion; this name eventually came to refer to the Legion itself. Later, in June 1935, the Legion changed its official name to the &quot;Totul pentru Ţară&quot; party, literally &quot;Everything for the Country&quot;, but commonly translated as &quot;Everything for the Fatherland&quot; or occasionally &quot;Everything for the Motherland&quot;. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

But in the specific case of the <span class="style_1">Italian conquest of British Somaliland</span>, the defeat (that happened in spring 1941) was followed by nearly two years of Italian guerrilla warfare. Other observations are: The invasion of British Somaliland showed that Italian forces could co-ordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; British forces showed good discipline in the retreat and were able to salvage most of their forces; the invasion of British Somaliland was the first campaign the Italians won in World War II; British Somaliland was the first British colony to fall to enemy forces in World War II; after the first months of the war were over, Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory (made of British Somaliland, the Sudan area around the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and Kassala, and the area in Kenya around Moyale and Buna) the size of England in the Horn of Africa; and, the campaign of British Somaliland in August 1940 was the only one in which the British army could not get strong support from the Royal Air Force, showing the importance of the air forces in the Allies' victories (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

This ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party which ruled theItalian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement, and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements. Italian Fascism supports the restoration of &quot;Italia Irredenta&quot; (claimed unredeemed Italian territories) to Italy and territorial expansionism. Italian Fascists claim that modern Italy is the heir to the Roman Empire and its territorial legacy, and support the creation of &quot;vital space&quot; for colonization by Italian settlers and establishing control over the Mediterranean Sea as Italy's Mare Nostrum. Italian Fascism promotes a corporatist economic system whereby employer and employee syndicates are linked together in a corporative associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy. Italian Fascists claim that this economic system resolves and ends class conflict by creating class collaboration. Etymologically, Fascismo (Fascism) derives from the Italian fascio (league), derived from the Latin fasces (bundles); the ancient Roman Symbol of Authority. It dates from Mussolini’s January 1915 and the 1919 establishment of the Fascist Revolutionary Party begun as the fasci di combattimento (combat leagues) popular movement. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Initially, the goal of the offensive was to seize the Suez Canal. To accomplish this, Italian forces from Libya would have to advance across northern Egypt to the canal. After numerous delays, the aim of the offensive was scaled back considerably. Ultimately, the goal was to advance into Egypt and attack any forces confronting the advance. . . In the end, the Italian invasion of Egypt did not get to the main British defensive positions. There never was a follow-up advance to Mersa Matruh. This invasion fell very far short of its original goal, the Suez Canal. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The April uprising showed to the world that not all Italians agreed with the Fascist rule. It proved that Italians were prepared to fight against Fascist rule at great cost. Casualties from the uprising amounted to: approximately 44,700 Italian partisans killed, approximately 21,200 Italian partisans wounded or disabled, approximately 15,000 Italian civilians killed in retaliations, and, approximately 40,000 former Italian soldiers died in concentration camps. During the war, German and Italian Fascist soldiers committed a number of other war crimes including: summary executions, ransacking, and retaliations against civilians. Most of these were common practices.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

The RSI exercised official sovereignty in northern Italy but was largely dependent on the Wehrmacht (German military) to maintain control. The state was informally known as the Salò Republic (Italian: <span class="style_1">Repubblica di Salò</span>) because the RSI's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mussolini) was headquartered in Salò, a small town on Lake Garda. Before 25 November 1943, when official title of the regime was adopted, the names Republican State of Italy and Republican National State were variously used. The Italian Social Republic was the second and last incarnation of a Fascist Italian state.

Horthy officially represented the abdicated Hungarian monarchy of Charles IV, Apostolic King of Hungary. Attempts by Charles IV to return to the throne were prevented by threats of war from neighboring countries and by the lack of support from Horthy. The Kingdom of Hungary under Horthy was an Axis Power during most of World War II. In 1944, Hungary was occupied by Nazi Germany, and Horthy was deposed. The Arrow Cross Party's leader Ferenc Szálasi established a new Nazi-backed government, effectively turning Hungary into a German puppet state. During the late spring and summer, the Germans forced the roundup and deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews to their extermination camps, where most died. After World War II, Hungary fell within the Soviet Union's sphere of interest. In 1946, the Second Hungarian Republic was established under Soviet control. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It existed until 1946 when the Italians opted for a republican constitution. . . During the time of the regime of the National Fascist Party from 1922 to its ousting in 1943, under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, the name often given by some historians to the Kingdom of Italy during this period is &quot;Fascist Italy&quot;. Under fascism, the Kingdom allied with Nazi Germany in World War II until 1943. In the remaining two years of World War II, the Kingdom of Italy switched sides to the Allies after ousting Mussolini as Prime Minister and banning the Fascist party. The remnant fascist state that continued fighting against the Allies was a puppet state of Nazi Germany, the &quot;Italian Social Republic&quot;, still led by Mussolini and his loyalist Fascists in northern Italy. Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to the Italian constitutional referendum, 1946 on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, which is the present form of Italy today. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The <span class="style_1">Kriegsmarine</span> was one of three official branches of the Wehrmacht, the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany. The <span class="style_1">Kriegsmarine</span> grew rapidly during German naval rearmaments under Plan Z, a large-scale plan calling for the construction of multiple naval vessels. The ships of the Kriegsmarine, some of which (mostly battlecruisers) were made under Plan Z, fought during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The commander-in-chief of the <span class="style_1">Kriegsmarine</span> was Adolf Hitler, who exercised his authority through the Oberkommando der Marine. The Kriegsmarine's most famous ships were the U-boat wolfpacks, constructed after Plan Z was abandoned on the eve of World War. They were submarine groups which seriously harassed Allied convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. Both the U-boats and pocket battleships were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the earlier years of the war. However, the adoption of convoy escorts later in the war greatly reduced the effectiveness of naval strikes on convoys. At the end of the Second World War, the Kriegsmarine's remaining ships were divided up amongst the Allied powers and were used for minesweeping.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 22, 2011.)</p>

It was formed in 1918 by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, formed from territories of the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire, with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Kingdom of Montenegro united with Serbia just five days earlier, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification. For its first eleven years of existence it was officially called Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the term Yugoslavia was its colloquial name from the very beginning. On 17 April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany and was reorganized into four provinces under foreign rule; a royal government-in-exile, recognized by the United Kingdom and later by all the Allied powers, was established in London. In 1943, the new country called Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed, and its capital was freed following the Belgrade Offensive. The King was formally deposed by the Constituent assembly on 29 November 1945. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

While the Finns saw this as a separate conflict much like the Continuation War, German forces considered their actions to be part of the Second World War. A peculiarity of the war was that the Finnish army was forced to demobilize their forces while at the same time fighting to force the German army to leave Finland. The German forces retreated to Norway, and Finland managed to uphold its promises made under the Moscow Armistice, although it remained formally still at war with the two Allied powers that were the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, one government in exile in London and the British Dominions until the formal conclusion of the Continuation War was ratified by the 1947 Paris peace treaty.

The League's primary goals, as stated in its Covenant, included preventing war through collective security, disarmament, and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Other issues in this and related treaties included labor conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, trafficking in persons and drugs, arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 12-14, 2011.)</p>

It served as the motivation for the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, aiming to provide extra space for the growth of the German population, for a Greater Germany. In Hitler's book Mein Kampf, he detailed his belief that the German people needed Lebensraum (&quot;living space&quot;, i.e. land and raw materials), and that it should be found in the East. It was the stated policy of the Nazis to kill, deport, or enslave the Polish, Russian and other Slavic populations, whom they considered inferior, and to repopulate the land with Germanic peoples. The entire urban population was to be exterminated by starvation, thus creating an agricultural surplus to feed Germany and allowing their replacement by a German upper class. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It was signed into law on March 11, 1941, a year and a half after the outbreak of the European war in September 1939, but nine months before the U.S. entrance into the war in December 1941. It was called An Act to Further Promote the Defense of the United States. Although it did not formally establish the United States as a combatant in the war, this act ended the pretense of its neutrality. Adolf Hitler recognized this and in response ordered German submarines to attack US vessels such as the <span class="style_1">SS Robin Moor</span>, an unarmed merchant steamship sunk on May 21, 1941 outside of the war zone. A total of $50.1 billion (equivalent to $759 billion at 2008 prices) worth of supplies were shipped: $31.4 billion to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France and $1.6 billion to China. Reverse Lend Lease comprised services (like rent on air bases) that went to the U.S. totaled $7.8 billion, of which $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth. The terms of the agreement provided that the material was to be used until time for their return or destruction. (Supplies after the termination date were sold to Britain at a discount, for £1.075 billion, using long-term loans from the U.S.) Canada operated a similar program that sent $4.7 billion in supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union. This program was a decisive step away from American non-interventionism since the end of World War I and towards international involvement. There was no debt; the U.S. did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

The capital region of France had been administered by Nazi Germany since the Second Compiègne armistice in June 1940 when Germany occupied the north and west of France and when the Vichy regime was created in city of Vichy in central France. The liberation started with an uprising by the French Resistance against the German Paris garrison. On 24 August, the French Forces of the Interior received backup from the Free French Army of Liberation and from the United States' 4th Infantry Division.This battle marked the end of Operation Overlord, the liberation of France by the Allies, the restoration of the French Republic and the exile of the Vichy government to Sigmaringen in Germany.

It was one of the largest Second World War operations, involving almost 4,000,000 troops on both sides and stretching on a 1400 kilometer long front. During this four-month operation, the eastern bank of the Dnieper was recovered from German forces by five of the Red Army's Fronts, which conducted several river assault crossings to establish several bridgeheads on the western bank. Subsequently, Kiev was liberated in a separate offensive. One of the costliest operations of the war, the casualties are estimated at being from 1,700,000 to 2,700,000 on both sides. The operation consisted of several smaller operational phases: Melitopol Offensive, Zaporozhye Offensive, Pyatikhatki Offensive, Znamenka Offensive and Dnepropetrovsk Offensive.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">The Maginot Line, named after French Minister of War André Maginot, was a line of concrete fortifications, tank obstacles, artillery casemates, machine gun posts, and other defenses, which France constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy, in light of its experience in World War I, and in the run-up to World War II. Generally the term describes only the defenses facing Germany, while the term Alpine Line is used for the Franco-Italian defenses. The French established the fortification to provide time for their army to mobilise in the event of attack, allowing French forces to move into Belgium for a decisive confrontation with German forces. The success of static, defensive combat in World War I was a key influence on French thinking. The fortification system successfully dissuaded a direct attack. However, it was strategically ineffective, as the Germans did indeed invade Belgium, defeated the French army, flanked the Maginot Line, and proceeded relatively unobstructed. Military experts extolled the Maginot Line as a work of genius, believing it would prevent any further invasions from the east (notably, from Germany). However, the German army in World War II largely bypassed the Maginot Line by invading through the Ardennes forest and via the Low countries, completely sweeping by the Line and conquering France in days. As such, the Maginot Line has come to mean a strategy or object that people put hope into but fails miserably. It is also the best known symbol of the adage that &quot;generals always fight the last war, especially if they have won it&quot;. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

It remained in effect until 22 June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol dividing Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence, anticipating potential &quot;territorial and political rearrangements&quot; of these countries. Thereafter, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded, on September 1 and 17 respectively, their respective sides of Poland, dividing the country between them. Part of eastern Finland was annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertza region. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

The Sudetenland were areas along Czech borders, mainly inhabited by ethnic Germans. The agreement was negotiated at a conference held in Munich, Germany, among the major powers of Europe without the presence of Czechoslovakia. Today, it is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Nazi Germany. The agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September). The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of the Sudetenland in the face of territorial demands made by Adolf Hitler. The agreement was signed by Nazi Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia, as most of its border defenses were situated there, and many of its banks were located there as well. Because the state of Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference, Czechs and Slovaks sometimes call the Munich Agreement the Munich Dictate. The phrase Munich Betrayal is also used because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France was not honored. Today the document is typically referred to simply as the Munich Pact. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Although he initially headed a coalition government, he quickly made Hindenburg a figurehead and eliminated his non-Nazi partners. The Nazi regime restored economic prosperity and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending while suppressing labor unions and strikes. The return of prosperity gave the regime enormous popularity and made his rule mostly unchallenged, although resistance grew after the onset of military aggression, culminating in the failed 20 July plot in 1944. The Gestapo (secret state police) under Heinrich Himmler destroyed the liberal, Socialist and Communist opposition and persecuted the Jews, attempting to force them into exile while taking their property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches. All expressions of public opinion were controlled by Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's skillful oratory. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its Führer (&quot;Leader&quot;), centralizing all power in his hands. Nazi propaganda centered on Hitler and was quite effective in creating what historians call the &quot;Hitler Myth&quot; – that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention. In reality, Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision-making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear. All top officials still reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies, but they had considerable autonomy on a daily basis. Hitler's foreign policy during the 1930s used a diplomatic strategy of making seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then moved on to his next goal. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (&quot;axis&quot;) with Benito Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), annexed Austria in the Anschluss (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with the Soviet Union (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war, resulting in the start of World War II - somewhat sooner than the Nazis had prepared for or expected. During the war, Germany conquered or controlled most of Europe and North Africa, intending to establish a &quot;New Order&quot; in Europe and elsewhere of complete Nazi German hegemony. The Nazis also persecuted and killed millions of Jews, Romani people and others in the Holocaust. Despite its Axis alliance with other nations, mainly Italy and Japan, by 8 May 1945 Germany had been defeated by the Allied Powers, and was occupied by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France. Some 40 million Europeans may have died as a consequence of the war. Hitler, the Nazis and their Holocaust became the symbol of evil in the modern world. Newman and Erber (2002) write, &quot;The Nazis have become one of the most widely recognized images of modern evil. Throughout most of the world today, the concept of evil can readily be evoked by displaying almost any cue reminiscent of Nazism....&quot; (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It was known as the German Workers' Party (DAP) prior to a change of name in 1920. The term Nazi is German and stems from Nationalsozialist, due to the pronunciation of Latin -tion- as -tsion- in German (rather than -shon- as it is in English), with German Z being pronounced as 'ts' as well. The party's last leader, Adolf Hitler, was appointed Chancellor of Germany by president Paul von Hindenburg in 1933. Hitler rapidly established a totalitarian regime known as the Third Reich. Nazi ideology stressed the failures of laissez-faire capitalism, communism, economic liberalism, and democracy; advocated Positive Christianity; supported the &quot;racial purity of the German people&quot; and that of other Northwestern Europeans; and claimed itself as the protector of Germany from Jewish influence and corruption. The Nazis persecuted those they perceived as either race enemies or Lebensunwertes Leben, that is &quot;life unworthy of living&quot;. This included Jews, Slavs, Roma, and so-called &quot;Mischlinge&quot; along with Communists, homosexuals, the mentally and physically disabled, and others. The persecution reached its climax when the party and the German state which it controlled organized the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews and six million other people from the other targeted groups, in what has become known as the Holocaust. Hitler's desire to build a German empire through expansionist policies led to the outbreak of World War II in Europe. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Most of these groups of Germans had lived outside Germany for hundreds of years, after moving eastwards between the 12th to 18th centuries. Despite this Hitler planned to move these people westwards (away from their homes and from the areas they had been living in for centuries) into Nazi Germany. However, Hitler also believed that the 1937 borders and territories of Nazi Germany, i.e. before the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (annexation) of Austria and the Sudetenland, were quite inadequate to accommodate this large increase in population. At this time the propaganda for more Lebensraum or &quot;living space&quot; greatly increased. . . Hitler's plan was to invade the western part of Poland (having assigned the eastern part to the Soviet Union in the pact) and then force all non German peoples (mostly Polish citizens) out of their homes and either use them for forced labour or move them further east to the General Government area. Once these territories were &quot;free&quot; of non Germans, the population transfers could begin and ethnic Germans would be settled in the same homes that until a few weeks earlier had Polish citizens living in them.

The landings commenced on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (D-Day), beginning at 6:30 AM British Double Summer Time (GMT+2). In planning, <span class="style_1">D-Day</span> was the term used for the day of actual landing, which was dependent on final approval. The landings were conducted in two phases: an airborne assault landing of 24,000 British, American, Canadian and Free French airborne troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious landing of Allied infantry and armored divisions on the coast of France starting at 6:30 AM. There were also decoy operations under the code names Operation Glimmer and Operation Taxable to distract the German forces from the real landing areas. The operation, planned by a team under Lieutenant-General Frederick Morgan, was the largest amphibious invasion in world history and was executed by land, sea and air elements under direct British command with over 160,000 troops landing on 6 June 1944. 195,700 Allied naval and merchant navy personnel in over 5,000 ships were involved. The invasion required the transport of soldiers and material from the United Kingdom by troop-laden aircraft and ships, the assault landings, air support, naval interdiction of the English Channel and naval fire-support. The landings took place along a 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

It led to the formation of a widely-based National Government led by Winston Churchill which was to govern Britain until the end of World War II in Europe. The debate (on May 7 and 8), ostensibly on the progress of the Norwegian campaign, brought to a head widespread dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the existing government, led by Neville Chamberlain, to the challenges of waging war. In the debate Chamberlain's government was criticized not only by the Opposition but by respected members of his own party. The Opposition forced a vote – effectively a vote of confidence – which the government won with a greatly reduced majority. With over a quarter of Government MPs voting with the opposition or abstaining despite a three line whip it was clear that support for Chamberlain in his own party was crumbling; and (particularly after ill-judged remarks by him in the course of the debate) it was not possible for him to form a coalition with the opposition Labour and Liberal Parties. Two days later Chamberlain resigned and was succeeded as Prime Minister by Churchill. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

In April 1940, the United Kingdom and France came to Norway's aid with an expeditionary force. Despite moderate success in the northern parts of Norway, Germany's invasion of France the following June compelled the Allies to withdraw and the Norwegian government to seek exile in London. The campaign subsequently ended with the occupation of Norway by Germany, and the continued fighting of exiled Norwegian forces from abroad. The conflict occurred between 9 April and 10 June 1940, the 62 days of fighting making Norway the nation that withstood a German invasion for the longest period of time, aside from the Soviet Union.

The trials were held in the city of Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany, in 1945-46, at the Palace of Justice. The first and best known of these trials was the Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT), which tried 24 of the most important captured leaders of Nazi Germany, though several key architects of the war (such as Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels) had committed suicide before the trials began. The initial trials were held from November 20, 1945 to October 1, 1946. The second set of trials of lesser war criminals was conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the US Nuremberg Military Tribunals (NMT); among them included the Doctors' Trial and the Judges' Trial. This article primarily deals with the IMT; see the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials for details on those trials.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

In September and October 1939 the Soviet government compelled the much smaller Baltic states to conclude mutual assistance pacts which gave the Soviets the right to establish military bases there. In the summer of 1940, through intimidation and the presence of the Red Army, the Baltic governments were compelled to resign. Under Soviet surveillance, new governments of Communists and fellow travelers arranged rigged elections. Soon the new puppet governments requested admission into the Soviet Union. The presidents of Estonia and Latvia were imprisoned and later died in Siberia. In June 1941 the new Soviet governments carried out mass deportations of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Consequently, at first many Balts greeted the Germans as liberators when they occupied the area. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

The Red Army repelled the Wehrmacht's strongest blow, and Adolf Hitler did not achieve the expected victory, but the Soviet Union's situation remained dire. Tactically, the Germans had won some resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the country, mainly in Ukraine. Despite these successes, the Germans were pushed back from Moscow and could never mount an offensive simultaneously along the entire strategic Soviet-German front again. Operation Barbarossa's failure led to Hitler's demands for further operations inside the USSR, all of which eventually failed, such as continuing the Siege of Leningrad, Operation Nordlicht, and Battle of Stalingrad, among other battles on the occupied Soviet territory. Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in human history in both manpower and casualties. Its failure was a turning point in the Third Reich's fortunes. Most important, Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front, to which more forces were committed than in any other theatre of war in world history. Operation Barbarossa and the areas that fell under it became the site of some of the largest battles, deadliest atrocities, highest casualties, and most horrific conditions for Soviets and Germans alike — all of which influenced the course of both World War II and 20th century history. The German forces captured 3 million Russian POWs, who did not enjoy the protection stipulated in the Geneva Conventions. Some 2/3 of them never returned alive.

The operation commenced on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, commonly known as D-Day). A 12,000-plane airborne assault preceded an amphibious assault involving almost 7,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June; more than 3 million troops were in France by the end of August. Allied land forces that saw combat in Normandy on D-Day itself came from Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Free French Forces and Poland also participated in the battle after the assault phase, and there were also minor contingents from Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and Norway. Other Allied nations participated in the naval and air forces. Once the beachheads were secured, a three-week military buildup occurred on the beaches before Operation Cobra, the operation to break out from the Normandy beachhead, began. The battle for Normandy continued for more than two months, with campaigns to expand the foothold on France, and concluded with the closing of the Falaise pocket on 24 August, the liberation of Paris on 25 August, and the German retreat across the Seine which was completed on 30 August 1944. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

While the American commanders favored Operation Sledgehammer, landing in Occupied Europe as soon as possible, the British commanders believed that such a course would end in disaster. An attack on French North Africa was proposed instead, which would clear the Axis Powers from North Africa, improve naval control of the Mediterranean Sea and prepare for an invasion of Southern Europe in 1943. American President Franklin D. Roosevelt suspected the African operation would rule out an invasion of Europe in 1943 but agreed to support British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

However, certain members of the Italian government, including the signatory Ciano, were opposed to the Pact. It was Italian leader Benito Mussolini who dubbed the agreement &quot;the Pact of Steel&quot;, after being told that its original name, &quot;the Pact of Blood&quot;, would likely be received poorly in Italy. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 23, 2011.)</p>

The various European powers had declared war on one another but neither side had committed to launching a significant land offensive, notwithstanding the terms of the Anglo-Polish military alliance and the Franco-Polish military alliance, which obliged the United Kingdom and France to assist Poland. The period was also called at the time, the Twilight War by Winston Churchill, <span class="style_1">der Sitzkrieg</span> in German (&quot;the sitting war&quot;: a play on the word <span class="style_1">Blitzkrieg</span>), the Bore War (a play on the Boer War), the Polish <span class="style_1">dziwna wojna</span> (&quot;strange war&quot;), and the French <span class="style_1">drôle de guerre</span> (&quot;strange/funny war&quot;). The American news magazine TIME called the period the <span class="style_1">Lullablitz</span>. The term Phoney War was possibly coined by U.S. Senator William Borah who stated in September 1939, &quot;There is something phoney about this war.&quot; (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Notable was the service of the Polish Air Force, not only in the Allied victory in the Battle of Britain but also the subsequent war in the air. Polish ground troops were present in the North Africa Campaign (siege of Tobruk); the Italian campaign (including the capture of the monastery hill at the Battle of Monte Cassino); and in battles following the invasion of France (the battle of the Falaise pocket; and an airborne brigade parachute drop during Operation Market Garden). Some Polish contributions were less visible, and most notably included the prewar and wartime deciphering of German Enigma machine codes by cryptologists Marian Rejewski and his colleagues. The Polish intelligence network also proved to be of much value to the Allied intelligence. The European theater of World War II opened with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. The Polish Army was defeated after over a month of fighting. After Poland had been overrun, a government-in-exile (headquartered in Britain), an armed forces, and an intelligence service were established outside of Poland. These organizations contributed to the Allied effort throughout the war. The Polish Army was recreated in the West, as well as in the East (after German invasion of the Soviet Union). As Poland never made a general surrender or produced a collaborative puppet government unlike France, it was directly governed by a purely German administration known as the <span class="style_1">Generalgouvernement</span>. This administration was in turn opposed by the Polish Underground State, which not only fielded one of the three largest partisan forces in existence, but was a unique underground government, a phenomenon not witnessed in other occupied countries. The Polish forces as a whole are considered to have been the 4th largest Allied army in Europe. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The first elements of the Underground State were put in place in the final days of the German invasion of Poland that begun in September 1939. The Underground State was perceived by supporters as a legal continuation of the pre-war Republic of Poland (and its institutions) that waged an armed struggle against the country's occupying powers: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Underground State encompassed not only military resistance, one of the largest in the world, but also civilian structures, such as education, culture and social services. The Underground State was not supported or recognized by the far right (nationalists) and far left (communists). Although the Underground State enjoyed broad support throughout much of the war, its influence declined amid military reversals (most notably, the failure of the Warsaw Uprising) and the growing hostility of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had created an alternative, puppet government in 1944 (the Polish Committee of National Liberation) and ensured it formed the basis of the post-war government in Poland. During the Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland at the end of the war, many involved with the Underground State were prosecuted as alleged traitors and died in captivity. Abandoned by the Western Allies, finding it impossible to negotiate with the Soviets, and wishing to avoid a civil war, the key institutions of the Underground State dissolved themselves in the first half of 1945. During the Cold War era, research on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by Polish scholars living in exile. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Truman. Stalin, Churchill, and Truman — as well as Attlee, who participated alongside Churchill while awaiting the outcome of the 1945 general election, and then replaced Churchill as Prime Minister after the Labour Party's victory over the Conservatives — gathered to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated Nazi Germany, which had agreed to unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier, on 8 May (V-E Day). The goals of the conference also included the establishment of post-war order, peace treaties issues, and countering the effects of war. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The offensive, and the battle for Prague, was fought on the Eastern Front from 6 May to 11 May 1945. This battle for the city is particularly noteworthy in that it ended after the Third Reich capitulated on 8 May 1945. This battle is also noteworthy in that it was fought concurrently with the Prague Uprising. The city of Prague was ultimately captured by the USSR during the Prague Offensive. All of the German troops of Army Group Centre (<span class="style_1">Heeresgruppe Mitte</span>) were killed or captured. The capitulation of Army Group Centre was nine days after the fall of Berlin and three days after Victory in Europe Day. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It grew into the national army of the Soviet Union. By the 1930s the Red Army was among the largest armies in history. The &quot;Red Army&quot; name refers to the traditional color of the workers' movement. On 25 February 1946 (when Soviet national symbols replaced revolutionary symbols), the Red Army was renamed the Soviet Army. The Red Army is widely credited with being the decisive force in the Allied victory in the European Theatre of World War II, having engaged and defeated about 80% of the German armed forces, the Wehrmacht and much of the Waffen SS on the Eastern Front. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

Following the decisive German victory in the Battle of France (10 May–21 June 1940), it established a German occupation zone in Northern France that encompassed all English Channel and Atlantic Ocean ports and left the remainder &quot;free&quot; to be governed by the French. Adolf Hitler deliberately chose Compiègne Forest as the site to sign the armistice due to its symbolic role as the site of the 1918 Armistice with Germany that signaled the end of World War I with Germany's surrender. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

The battle took place over 14 days from 23 October – 5 November 1942. The First Battle of El Alamein had stalled the Axis advance. Thereafter, Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the British Eighth Army from General Claude Auchinleck in August 1942. The Allied victory turned the tide in the North African Campaign. It ended Axis hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and gaining access to the Middle Eastern oil fields. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 15-17, 2011.)</p>

It was fought towards the end of World War II in Europe, during the Soviet Budapest Offensive. The siege started when Budapest, defended by Hungarian and German troops, was first encircled on 29 December 1944 by the Red Army and the Romanian Army. The siege ended when the city unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945. The besieging Soviet forces were part of Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front. Formations that actually took part in the fighting appear to have included the 53rd Army, 7th Guards Army, portions of the 3rd Ukrainian Front, including the 46th Army, and the Romanian 7th Army Corps. Arrayed against the Soviets was a collection of German Army, <span class="style_1">Waffen-SS</span>, and Hungarian Army forces. The Siege of Budapest was one of the bloodiest of World War II.

It started on 8 September 1941, when the last land connection to the city was severed. Although the Soviets managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, lifting of the siege took place on 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began. It was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history and one of the most costly in terms of casualties. (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 25, 2011.)</p>

From 1940-1942, the fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. . . By November 1942, the Axis had lost the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Allies landed forces in Vichy French Morocco and Algeria under Operation Torch. The Axis diverted their forces to the Battle of Tunisia, and attacks on Malta were rapidly reduced. The siege effectively ended in November 1942. In December 1942, air and sea forces operating from Malta went over to the offensive. By May 1943, they had sunk 230 Axis ships in 164 days, the highest Allied sinking rate of the war. The Allied victory played a major role in the eventual Allied success in North Africa.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 25, 2011.)</p>

It went into effect on the day it was signed. It was registered in <span class="style_1">League of Nations Treaty Series</span> on September 8, 1937. . . At first the treaty led to improving relations between the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek's government and the USSR. Following the signing of the pact, the Soviet Union began sending aircraft to the Chinese national government in Operation Zet, as well as economic aid to help stave off Japanese occupation. Chiang hoped this was a precursor to Soviet intervention into the war, however as time passed he soon realized that the USSR was constricted in what aid it could actually provide, due to not wanting to upset the tacit alliance with Britain, France, and later the United States, who favored China in the war but, would back Japan against the USSR in order to weaken both. The treaty also allowed the USSR to focus its attention more on the Western border where Nazi Germany was building up for what appeared to be war with the USSR especially after the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact was signed. The pact contributed to the worsening relationship between China and Nazi Germany, which culminated in the end of German military assistance in China. The treaty was one of the first diplomatic treaties after the fall of Imperial China. . . Ironically, in 1937, while the pact was being signed, the Soviets brazenly breached it before and after the signing, conducting the Xinjiang War (1937) from August to October.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 25, 2011.)</p>

It was launched on August 29 1944 from Banská Bystrica in an attempt to overthrow the collaborationist Slovak State of Jozef Tiso. Although the rebel forces were defeated by Nazi Germany, guerrilla warfare continued until the Soviet Army occupied Slovakia in 1945. In the post-war period, many political entities attempted to &quot;hijack&quot; the uprising to their credit. The Stalinist regime in Czechoslovakia presented the Uprising as an event initiated and governed by communist forces. Slovak nationalists, on the other hand, claim that the uprising was a plot against the Slovak nation, as one of its main objectives was to oust the regime of the puppet Slovak state and reestablish Czechoslovakia, in which Slovaks were dominated by Czechs. In fact, many factions fought in the uprising, including large rebel units of the Slovak Army, nationalist and communist partisans, and international forces. Given this factionalization, the Uprising did not have unambiguous popular support. Yet, the participants and supporters of the Uprising represented every religion, class, gender, age, and anti-Nazi political faction of the Slovak nation.  (wikipedia.org.  Accessed August 25, 2011.)</p>
