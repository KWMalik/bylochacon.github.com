                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;As massive human suffering continues to engulf the Darfur region of Sudan, the crisis has garnered a rhetorical circus of saber-rattling and hand wringing from Western politicians, media, and activists. Yet such bluster has not halted the violence. In a careful yet scathing indictment of this constellation of holier-than-thou government leaders, corporate media outlets, and spoon-fed NGOs, Steven Fake and Kevin Funk reveal the myriad ways in which the West has failed Darfur. From neglecting to provide sufficient humanitarian aid to millions of displaced Darfurians, to refusing to adequately support peacekeepers deployed in the region, the West has amply demonstrated its unwillingness to bridge the chasm between rhetoric and reality. Eschewing liberal fantasies of Western benevolence, Fake and Funk unmask the hard reality behind &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; advocacy, as well as the true nature of US-Sudanese relations. What emerges is a methodical and disturbing portrait of Washington's ongoing ties with some of the worst elements of the Khartoum regime. The authors delve deeply into the immensely harmful and little-known role that Washington has played in the country by decisively backing a series of repressive governments in Khartoum. Brutal enough in their own right, these machinations also set the stage for escalating conflict in Sudan, culminating in the present catastrophe. While its criticism of Western activism is unflinching, Scramble for Africa nonetheless offers the hope that an international response can play a role in alleviating the crisis. Not content to merely wash their hands of the question of how to fight for a more just future for Darfur, Fake and Funk carefully assess the merits of deploying an international peacekeeping force, and propose carefully reasoned avenues for activism. By exposing the West's shedding of crocodile tears over Darfur, Fake and Funk offer an opportunity to take a fresh, uncorrupted perspective on the crisis. Just such a vantage point is necessary if the West is to offer any true aid to the people of Darfur. Amazon.com. 208 pages.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;[Hagan and Richmond] make excellent use of an important archive: interviews with more than one thousand Darfuris that were done as part of the study launched by the State Department in 2004. That archive provides a solid empirical basis for research, and the authors use it effectively to argue, for example, that racism against black Africans was more of a factor than many observers believe.&quot; --Nicholas Kristof, The New York Review of Books. In 2004, the State Department gathered more than a thousand interviews from refugees in Chad that verified Colin Powell's U.N. and congressional testimonies about the Darfur genocide. The survey cost nearly a million dollars to conduct and yet it languished in the archives as the killing continued, claiming hundreds of thousands of murder and rape victims and restricting several million survivors to camps. This book for the first time fully examines that survey and its heartbreaking accounts. It documents the Sudanese government's enlistment of Arab Janjaweed militias in destroying black African communities. The central questions are: Why is the United States so ambivalent to genocide? Why do so many scholars deemphasize racial aspects of genocide? How can the science of criminology advance understanding and protection against genocide? This book gives a vivid firsthand account and voice to the survivors of genocide in Darfur. Amazon.com. 296 pages.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;Unique,&quot; a word avoided by most journalists, is just the first to describe this heart-stopping memoir, written by a native Darfuri translator who, after escaping the massacre of his village by the genocidal Janjaweed, returned to work with reporters and UN investigators in the riskiest of situations. Taking readers far from their comfort zones, Hari charts the horrific landscape of genocide in the stories of refugee camp survivors: &quot;It is interesting how many ways there are for people to be hurt and killed, and for villages to be terrorized and burned... I would say that these ways to die and suffer are unspeakable, and yet they were spoken: we interviewed 1,134 human beings over the next weeks.&quot; Danger is rampant, especially at border crossings, and the effect on outsiders is profound: &quot;Some of the BBC people had to return to Chad, where they were in a medical clinic for three days to recover from what they saw, and smelled, and learned.&quot; Homey facts about the loyalty of camels, the pecking order in villages and vast family networks bring respite from more dire tales, including Hari's long, multi-site imprisonment with a U.S. journalist and their Chadian driver. The captives' endurance through uncertainty and torture is unbelievable, and their eventual rescue reads like James Bond by way of boldface politicos like recent presidential contender Bill Richardson. Throughout, Hari demonstrates almost incomprehensible decency; those with the courage to join Hari's odyssey may find this a life-changing read.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">Imagine you’re a young boy—maybe as young as three or four—separated from your family by civil war, traversing deserts and mountains with little food or water, no medical care, and no protection from wild animals. Imagine watching hundreds of boys perish around you from hunger, disease, or attacks by enemy soldiers and wild animals. To most of us, it is unimaginable, but this was reality for &quot;The Lost Boys of Sudan,&quot; thousands of young boys who were separated from their families and forced to walk approximately 1,000 miles to reach safe refuge from war and certain death. For the first time, this award winning book offers readers a chronological timeline of the epic journey taken by these children, beginning in their rural villages of Southern Sudan and ending with their arrival as young men to the United States. Narrated through the voice of Joan Hecht, one of their American mentors, whom they lovingly call &quot;mom&quot; or &quot;Mama Joan;&quot; &quot;The Journey of the Lost Boys&quot; is a compelling story of courage, faith and the sheer determination to survive by a group of young orphaned boys. Because of Joan Hecht’s personal relationship with them, she is able to portray their story in a way that most famous reporters and authors cannot. In addition to her extensive research of the political and historical events surrounding the long lasting civil war in Sudan, are the heart-rending personal stories and original drawings of the boys themselves. A must read for anyone interested in the the true story of the Lost Boys of Sudan! Amazon.com. 168 pages. (education, young adult)</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">Douglas Johnson has written a landmark book that deserves not only to change the nature of Sudan studies but how we think of war, peace and development generally. It is a task for which he is well qualified. As a historian with an anthropologist's eye, his interests span pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Unique among contemporary writers, Johnson has not only made major contributions to the historiography of Sudan and the interpretation of its rich ethnography, he has also worked for the aid agencies that now populate much of this country. From this wide vantage point Johnson's critical book succeeds in rescuing Sudan from the heart of darkness that continues to be conjured by whistle-stop journalists and self-serving NGOs. Writing from the perspective of South Sudan he also addresses the long-standing bias in Sudan studies and the international mediation efforts in the current war: an implicit affirmation and tacit collusion with the expansive institutions of northern Arab society at the expense of its politically disadvantaged African hinterland... Douglas Johnson has written an important book. Not least, because it brings politics back into the North-South equation...Only with self-determination being a real option - something that successive governments have fudged or rejected - is there a possibility to negotiate a robust and equitable settlement. Without this, as in the past, peace will be a smoke-screen behind which the political antagonism between free and servile subjects will continue its violent and destructive work. - Mark Duffield in JOURNAL OF REFUGEE STUDIES This authoritative and detailed study of Sudan's contemporary conflicts aims to discourage quick fix thinking by tracing the historical patterns of power and politics that have brought the country to its current impasse...Never just a matter of competition between religions, races, or regions, Sudan's multiple internal conflicts today are as seemingly intractable as ever, despite serious peace efforts. Students and researchers will benefit from the extended bibliographic essay and chronology included in this excellent book. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 256 pages.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">Winner of the 2007 Lucie Award: powerHouse Books for Photography Book Publisher of the Year. In June 2007, powerHouse Books released Darfur: Twenty Years of War and Genocide in Sudan, a collaboration with three humanitarian organizations and five of the world’s top photo agencies. The book, filled with haunting images and testimonials that displayed the desperate and severe reality of the Sudan crisis, sold out its initial run in just a few months, helping to raise much-needed money for this desperate cause. Now, Darfur arrives in paperback. Even by conservative estimates, the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan is grave. There are 3.5 million people who are hungry, 2.5 million who have been displaced by violence, and 400,000 individuals who have died since the crisis began in 2003. The international community has failed to take steps to protect civilians, or to influence the Sudanese government to intervene. Darfur: Twenty Years of War and Genocide in Sudan is the product of a close partnership between Amnesty International USA, Proof: Media for Social Justice, and the Holocaust Museum Houston. Featuring the work of eight prominent photographers, the book covers three periods in the Sudan crisis, including images shot in 1988, when an estimated 250,000 Sudanese died of starvation; images from 1992 and 1995 that capture the atrocities of a civil war, when hundreds of thousands fled their homes to other destinations in Sudan or left the country altogether; and images from 2005 and more recently, bringing to light the severity of the humanitarian crisis underway, with the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias committing systematic violence on the people of Darfur. The book includes website links and additional resources for readers to utilize in seeking an urgent, immediate, and international call to action and to raise awareness of this human suffering. <span style="line-height: 12px; " class="style_1">ALL PROCEEDS FROM THE BOOK WILL BENEFIT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA AND GENOCIDE INTERVENTION NETWORK. </span>Amazon.com. 135 pages.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">In February, 2003, the Sudanese Liberation Army in Darfur (the western region of Sudan) after years of oppression took up arms against the Sudanese government. The government and allied militias answered the rebellion with mass murder, rape and the wholesale destruction of villages and livelihood, resulting in one of the world's largest humanitarian and political crises. Up to 2 million people were displaced; 400,000 people killed. In October and November, 2004, after watching woefully inadequate media coverage on the crisis in Darfur, a team of three independent filmmakers trekked to Darfurian refugee camps in eastern Chad and crept across the border into Darfur. They met dozens of Darfurians, and spoke with them about their history, hopes and fears, and the tragedy they are living. Refugees and displaced peoples, civilians and fighters resisting the Sudanese government, teachers, students, parents, children and community leaders provide the heart of Darfur Diaries. Their stories and testimonies, woven together through the personal experience of the filmmakers, and conveyed with political and historical context, provide a much-needed account to help understand Darfur. These are people whose lives, homes, safety and rights deserve to be protected as vigilantly as those of peoples all over the world. Amazon.com. 256 pages.</p>

His breathtaking photographs and compelling narrative tell the definitive story of the conflict and will help the readers across the globe to understand the true nature of the genocide and the people caught up in it every day.... I applaud him for this wonderful book and join him in his urgent cry for help for those oppressed in Sudan who cannot speak for themselves.&quot; - Governor Bill Richardson, from the Foreword&quot;. Darfur, located in westernmost Sudan, is that nation's largest region, situated on the border with Chad. For centuries, northern Sudan has been predominantly Arab Muslim and the south, black African. Ruled as a colonial state by, primarily, Egypt and Britain, Sudan was granted independence in 1956 with Khartoum, in the northern Arab Muslim territory, as its seat of power. In 1983, the Sudanese government announced that all of Sudan would officially be a Muslim country. The &quot;sharia,&quot; the Muslim code of laws, became the rule: those not Muslim are deemed unclean and infidels. Southern Sudan began resisting the genocide waged by the Muslim north. This resistance led to the 1992 announcement of a holy jihad by the Sudanese government, leading to today's humanitarian crisis in Darfur. Amazon.com. 128 pages.</p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;A passionate and highly readable account of the current tragedy that combines intimate knowledge of the region's history, politics, and sociology with a telling cynicism about the polite but ineffectual diplomatic efforts to end it. It is the best account available of the Darfur crisis.&quot;--Foreign Affairs. &quot;The emergency in Darfur in western Sudan is far from over, as Gérard Prunier points out in this comprehensive and authoritative book. . . . He concisely covers the history, the conflicts, and the players. . . . Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide is essential for anyone wanting to learn about this complex conflict.&quot;--Library Journal. &quot;If Darfuris are Muslim, what is their quarrel with the Islamic government in Khartoum? If they and the janjaweed-'evil horsemen'-driving them from their homes are both black, how can it be Arab versus African? If the Sudanese government is making peace with the south, why would it be risking that by waging war in the west? Above all, is it genocide? Gérard Prunier has the answers. An ethnographer and renowned Africa analyst, he turns on the evasions of Khartoum the uncompromising eye that dissected Hutu power excuses for the Rwanda genocide a decade ago.&quot;--The Guardian. Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide explains what lies behind the conflict in Western Sudan, how it came about, why it is should not be oversimplified, and why it is so relevant to the future of Africa. As the world watches, governments decide if, when, and how to intervene, and international organizations struggle to distribute aid, Gérard Prunier's book provide crucial assistance.

He has been the thorn in the conscience of policymakers, scholars, journalists and readers of The New Republic for several years with his erudite and provocative writings. This book collects the best of them with highly readable essays. Historians will rely on A Long Day's Dying for the in-depth analyses and critical judgments of every step taken, and not taken, during the years of atrocity crimes in Darfur. Place this book in the Oval Office.&quot; --Professor David Scheffer, Northwestern University School of Law (Former U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, 1997-2001). &quot;Not a single person in the world has done as much for Darfur as Eric Reeves. Combining passion, reason, black humor, legal acuity, and political savvy, Reeves sends us all off in search of our better angels. What you have in these pages are the brilliant, fierce, rigorous writings of a one-man-lobbying machine who is single-handedly responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of lives&quot;. --Samantha Power, Pulitzer Prize winning author of (A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide) Professor, Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The main theme of this new book is that the Khartoum regime is committing genocide in Darfur while the international community watches in silence or with mere hand-wringing. Publication of such an important book, at this critical moment in the Darfur genocide, offers to government officials, academics, humanitarian aid groups, human rights organizations, as well as to the broader public an in-depth critical assessment of the current situation in Darfur. It also provides an unsparing assessment of the international community s diplomatic efforts, past and present, to respond to Darfur. Such an assessment comes at a defining moment. The world is watching clearly and yet responding weakly. Action is essential now if we are not to see a further extension of the international failures so conspicuous in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Amazon.com. 386 pages.</p>

Armed with a camera and notebook, Steidle chronicled his six-month mission, witnessing the harrowing aftermath of violence and the ongoing genocide. He found himself in the line of fire, was taken hostage, and ultimately morphed into a correspondent as he unburdened himself via e-mails sent home. He recounts the ineffectiveness he felt in his role as observer and his frustration that the international community has done so little to intervene in the massive killing of non-Arab citizens. More than a firsthand account of the horrors of genocide, this is a stirring account of one man's transformation in the face of the inhumanity of senseless death, and the occasional moments of humanity in the midst of violence.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3">Daly (A History of the Sudan), arguably the world's most knowledgeable authority on Darfur, enlists history, politics, economics and geography to disentangle the reasons why up to 400,000 people have been killed and millions more displaced in the continuing genocide. A frontier province that resembles the Wild West, Darfur blends plague, famine, drought, cattle rustling, messianic revivalism and Great Power politics with benign and not-so-benign neglect from the centers of power in Khartoum, Cairo and London; as Daly puts it, [a]bility to conquer but inability to rule might have been the epitaph of successive regimes in Darfur. But the subject matter is often obscured by Daly's overly pedantic tone and compendia of eminent personages and their tribal and religious affiliations. The dedicated reader will require a detailed flowchart to keep the cast of characters straight. The first sections recount Darfur's time as an independent sultanate, a colony and finally part of an independent Sudan; only the last 50 pages or so deal directly with the current crisis. Though Daly makes no explicit predictions, he is less than sanguine about the prospects of the peace process in the near term.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">Darfur's Sorrow is the first general history of Darfur to be published in any language. The book surveys events from before the founding of the Fur sultanate in the sixteenth century through the rise and establishment of the Fur state and its incorporation into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in 1916. The narrative continues with detailed coverage of the brief but all-important colonial period (1916-1956) and Darfur's history as a neglected peripheral region since independence. The political, economic, environmental, and social factors that gave rise to the current humanitarian crisis are discussed in detail, as are the course of Darfur's rebellion, its brutal suppression by the Sudanese government, and the lawless brigands known as janjawid. The second edition of the book brings the story up to date and includes an analysis of attempts to save Darfur's embattled people and to bring an end to the fighting. Amazon.com. 368 pages.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">In response to the ongoing mass murder of Black Sudanese groups in the Darfur region of Sudan by Sudanese government troops and Arab militias, the US government sent the Darfur Atrocities Documentation Team to various points along the Chad/Sudan in order to interview refugees from Darfur. Based on their investigation, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell formally announced that &quot;genocide has occurred in Darfur and may still be occurring.&quot; The United States officially accused the government of Sudan of perpetrating genocide -- the first time that any government has officially and publicly accused another government of genocide. As a result the United States played a key role in pressuring the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution calling for several measures, including an official UN Commission of Inquiry to conduct a genocide investigation in Sudan itself. This was the first time that any signatory of the Genocide Convention actually triggered provisions of the Convention requiring a UN Security Council response while a genocide was occurring. This book is comprised of essays from contributors who were involved in designing the project and hiring and training investigators, interpreters, and support personnel; US government and nongovernmental organization (NGO) officials involved in the genesis of the project as well as the analysis of the data; and numerous scholars, not all of whom were directly involved with the project, who will critique aspects of the documentation project as well as its significance.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3">Writing with BBC correspondent Lewis (Slave), Bashir, a physician and refugee living in London, offers a vivid personal portrait of life in the Darfur region of Sudan before the catastrophe. Doted on by her father, who bucked tradition to give his daughter an education, and feisty grandmother, who bequeathed a fierce independence, Bashir grew up in the vibrant culture of a close-knit Darfur village. (Its darker side emerges in her horrific account of undergoing a clitoridectomy at age eight.) She anticipated a bright future after medical school, but tensions between Sudan's Arab-dominated Islamist dictatorship and black African communities like her Zaghawa tribe finally exploded into conflict. The violence the author recounts is harrowing: the outspoken Bashir endured brutal gang-rapes by government soldiers, and her village was wiped out by marauding Arab horsemen and helicopter gunships. This is a vehement cri de coeur—I wanted to fight and kill every Arab, to slaughter them, to drive them out of the country, the author thought upon treating girls who had been raped and mutilated—but in showing what she suffered, and lost, Bashir makes it resonate.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">The Darfur conflict has presented the international community with a number of challenges. How can the fighting be stopped in Darfur? What can be done to save lives and help the two million people displaced by the conflict? And how to help bring about peace, whilst ensuring that the peace agreement for the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983 - 2005) is implemented? Drawing on original research, and tracing the history of international responses to the conflicts in Sudan, Richard Barltrop investigates what has determined the outcomes of international mediation and relief in Sudan. In the process, he shows that Darfur must be seen within the wider context of conflict in Sudan, and that lessons should be drawn both for Sudan and for the effective practice of conflict resolution. Richard Barltrop is an independent researcher and consultant who has travelled extensively in Sudan. He holds a PhD in International Relations from the University of Oxford.

A first-rate piece of work about the central dilemmas facing governments, international organizations, NGOs, and citizens.' - Professor Thomas G. Weiss, The CUNY Graduate Center, USA.   'For me, this important book teaches us, through the evidence provided by regional specialists on Darfur from a variety of countries, that there is less to the notions of 'international society', 'international community', 'good international citizenship', 'solidarism', and 'responsibility to protect' than their official and academic proponents claim. Tragically, such a verdict is always likely to be starkest when 'mass atrocities' occur in Africa.' - Professor Ken Booth FBA, Senior Research Associate, Aberystwyth University, UK.     The ongoing crisis in Darfur, Sudan has stimulated a huge amount of political and academic interest across the world. The crisis has been both reflective and constitutive of key areas of contestation and change within contemporary international society. This book examines the crisis in Darfur as a case study of some of the wider debates currently taking place within International Relations theory. Using the conceptual framework developed by English School theorists, specifically their concept of international society and the related idea of &quot;good international citizenship&quot;, this book examines a wide range of issues: foreign policy analysis, theories of norm diffusion, international organizations, peace operations, international criminal justice and war law, the causes and nature of contemporary warfare, and the international relations of Africa. Making an important contribution to the debate about the meaning and limits of international society, this book will be of interest to students and scholars international relations theory, international security, foreign policy, international organizations, human rights, African politics, genocide studies and international law.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;Burr and Collins' account constitutes an excellent history of the region's politics, providing many useful insights into the current conflict.&quot; - Foreign Affairs. Images of the genocide in Darfur have shocked the Western world: Upwards of 300,000 of its inhabitants have died, and another 2.5 million have become refugees. Those affected by the violence are estimated at almost 4 million, 700,000 of whom are now beyond the reach of humanitarian assistance. These are staggering numbers, and the fractious insurgent groups involved - Islamist Arab tribal militias against Christian black Africans and other militias made up of deserters of the Chad Army - were and still are supported to kill, rob, and terrorize by the governments of the neighboring states of the Sudan, Chad, and Libya.In &quot;Darfur; The Long Road to Disaster&quot;, Burr and Collins have updated their original 1999 volume with additional chapters. The new title is not a publisher's gimmick: this is indeed the prehistory of Darfur's tragedy, and it is essential, if difficult, reading for any serious student of the crisis.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">Over the past two decades, the situation in Africa’s largest country, Sudan, has progressively deteriorated: the country is in second position on the Failed States Index, a war in Darfur has claimed hundreds of thousands of deaths, President Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court, a forthcoming referendum on independence for Southern Sudan threatens to split the country violently apart. In this fascinating and immensely readable book, the Africa editor of the Economist gives an absorbing account of Sudan’s descent into failure and what some have called genocide. Drawing on interviews with many of the main players, Richard Cockett explains how and why Sudan has disintegrated, looking in particular at the country’s complex relationship with the wider world. He shows how the United States and Britain were initially complicit in Darfur—but also how a broad coalition of human-rights activists, right-wing Christians, and opponents of slavery succeeded in bringing the issues to prominence in the United States and creating an impetus for change at the highest level. Dr. Richard Cockett has been Africa editor of the Economist since 2005. He was previously a senior lecturer in politics and history at the University of London. Amazon.com. 320 pages.<br /></p>

It put people's coping strategies on the map, as well as the importance of disease-led mortality.&quot;--Dr David Keen, Reader in Complex Emergencies, London School of Economics. &quot;The best book ever written about the region.&quot;--John Prendergast, International Crisis Group. In 2004, Darfur, Sudan was described as the &quot;world's greatest humanitarian crisis.&quot; Twenty years previously, Darfur was also the site of a disastrous famine. Famine that Kills is a seminal account of that famine, and a social history of the region. In a new preface prepared for this revised edition, Alex de Waal analyzes the roots of the current conflict in land disputes, social disruption and impoverishment. Despite vast changes in the nature of famines and in the capacity of response, de Waal's original challenge to humanitarian theory and practice including a focus on the survival strategies of rural people has never been more relevant. Documenting the resilience of the people who suffered, it explains why many fewer died than had been predicted by outsiders. It is also a pathbreaking study of the causes of famine deaths, showing how outbreaks of infectious disease killed more people than starvation. Now a classic in the field, Famine that Kills provides critical background and lessons of past intervention for a region that finds itself in another moment of humanitarian tragedy.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">Raised by Sudan's Dinka tribe, the Deng brothers and their cousin Benjamin were all under the age of seven when they left their homes after terrifying attacks on their villages during the Sudanese civil war. In 2001, the three were relocated to the U.S. from Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp as part of an international refugee relief program. Arriving in this country, they immediately began to fill composition books with the memoirs of chaos and culture shock collected here. Well written, often poetic essays by Benson, Alepho and Benjamin, who are now San Diego residents in their mid-20s, are arranged in alternating chapters and recall their childhood experiences, their treacherous trek and their education in the camp (&quot;People were learning under trees&quot;). Other pieces remember the rampant disease and famine among refugees, and the tremendous hardship of day-to-day living (&quot;Refugee life was like being devoured by wild animals&quot;). When the boys arrived in America, Benson, upon seeing a Wal-Mart for the first time, remarked, &quot;This is like a king's palace.&quot; Although some readers may wish for more commentary on what life in America is like for these transplants, this collection is moving in its depictions of unbelievable courage.

Kristof in The New York Review of Books. The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur has stirred politicians, Hollywood celebrities and students to appeal for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Beyond the horrific pictures of sprawling refugee camps and lurid accounts of rape and murder lies a complex history steeped in religion, politics, and decades of internal unrest. Darfur traces the origins, organization and ideology of the infamous Janjawiid and other rebel groups, including the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement. It also analyzes the confused responses of the Sudanese government and African Union. This thoroughly updated edition also features a powerful analysis of how the conflict has been received in the international community and the varied attempts at peacekeeping.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3">For over four years a bloody conflict has raged in the Darfur region in the western part of Sudan. Initially a reaction by the Arab-dominated Sudanese government to a rebellion attack in El Fasher by the SLA (Sudan Liberation Army), today it has escalated to a complex and tangled conflict. At the first sign of attack, the government sent local Arab nomad tribes, so-called janjaweed, to fight the rebels alongside government troops. These warriors on horseback were directed to seek out the SLA members in the villages where they were supposed to live, massacring anybody on their way, and left free to destroy or burn whatever was left behind. Four years later, and the result has been a gradual mass genocide of black civilians, with an estimate suggesting that more than 200,000 have been killed so far. Over 2 million are now living as displaced people in refugee camps, with nothing left of their homes, often separated from their family. What started as a reaction to squash a rebellion, has turned into a massive exercise of power by the Sudanese government, lead by President Bashir. Today the situation is further complex still, as the government hands out arms to any side, Arab or African, who declare themselves against the rebels. In some cases they have even armed both sides of the same mini-conflict. Further, the war has spread into Chad and the Central African Republic. Since November 2006 eastern Chad has had more than 200,000 IDP's (Internally Displaced People) due to janjaweed attacks on their side of the border. The real purpose of procrastinating and enlarging the conflict is to keep people busy with a constant crisis, so that the &quot;divide and destroy&quot; policy can ensure that the booming oil revenues remain in the same hands. The result, a silent genocide. Amazon.com. 240 pages.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3">&quot;Path-breaking ... one of the first books to analyze Darfur from a humanities and media studies perspective, and a major contribution to genocide research.&quot; Gregory Stanton, president, The International Association of Genocide Scholars   The crisis in Darfur has led to systemic and widespread murder, rape, and abduction, as well as the forced displacement of millions of civilians. It presents a defining moral challenge to the world. &quot;The World and Darfur&quot; brings together genocide scholars from a range of disciplines - social history, art history, military history, African studies, media studies, literature, political science, sociology - to provide a cohesive and nuanced understanding of the international response to the crisis in Western Sudan. Contributing authors, including Eric Reeves, Frank Chalk, Eric Markusen, and Samuel Totten, look at the lessons learned from the United Nations failure to intervene during the Rwandan genocide, the representation of Darfur in the mainstream media, atrocity investigations, activist and NGO campaigns, art exhibitions and political rhetoric, and the role of the international community in the discourse of genocide prevention and intervention. A common theme is the succession of political, bureaucratic, and informational barriers that have prevented the international community from staging effective action to quell the crimes against humanity in Darfur. The situation in Darfur continues to deteriorate and it is clear that the current UN peacekeeping mission is woefully inadequate for civilian protection. An effective genocide prevention campaign depends on international response and public will. &quot;The World and Darfur&quot; is an important part of this dialogue, providing valuable insights for scholars, human rights activists, and the concerned general public.

                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">DARFUR/DARFUR: LIFE/WAR is a powerful collection of images from some of the world's most celebrated photojournalists who have documented an ongoing genocide that has claimed more than 300,000 lives and has displaced about 2.5 million people. Launched in September 2006, Darfur/Darfur, the exhibit to which the book is the companion, consists of over 150 color and black-and-white images by seven international photojournalists and one former U.S. Marine and has gained massive national and international attention. It has been shown in museums such as the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, the Eastman House, Rochester, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., and the Jewish Museum in Berlin. Future venues include the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, and FORMA, Milan. In January 2007, Darfur/Darfur became the first exhibit on the crisis to be presented on the African continent. Amzaon.com. 208 pages.</p>
